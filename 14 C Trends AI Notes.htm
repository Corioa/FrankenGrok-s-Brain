</b><i>“fireflies.ai transcribed this meeting but I'm wondering if you can
ferret out a price action trading strategy for a day trader in the style of al
brooks' methodology from the following”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on the transcription of Al Brooks discussing his
trading strategy, here's how a day trader might approach price action trading
in his style:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding Trends:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Types of Trends:</b> Trends can be classified based on
     their behavior. Brooks describes trends as either breakouts or channels. </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakouts</b> are characterized by strong,
      high-probability movements where the market moves decisively in one
      direction. These can be bull or bear breakouts, often marked by a series
      of trend bars closing on their highs or lows with little overlap between
      bars.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channels</b> are weaker trends where the market
      oscillates within a price range, showing two-sided trading where bulls
      and bears take turns controlling the market.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Identifying Bull and Bear Trends:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends:</b> Look for sequences of bullish bars
     closing near their highs, with minimal pullback. A trend might begin with
     a gap or a strong breakout bar. The urgency in buying upon bar closure is
     a sign of a strong bull trend.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Example: A series of bull trend bars with small pullbacks
      indicates a strong bull trend. Buying opportunities are better when the
      market shows a clear breakout or a breakout from a small pullback.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends:</b> Characterized by bearish bars closing
     near their lows, often following a bear breakout. The selling urgency
     after a bar closes signals strong momentum.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Example: Continuous bear trend bars with little overlap
      suggest persistent selling pressure. Selling short is advisable,
      especially when the market shows relentless movement downward with
      minimal pullbacks.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Traps and Breakouts:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Traps:</b> Beginners often get trapped into bad trades
     by focusing solely on risk, leading to selling in bull trends or buying in
     bear trends due to perceived low risk, ignoring low probability of
     success.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoidance:</b> In a confirmed bull trend, avoid short
      selling; in a bear trend, avoid buying. Focus on the probability rather
      than just the risk.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakouts:</b> Every trend starts with a breakout,
     which could be a single bar or a series of bars. Understanding when a
     breakout is likely to fail (trap) or succeed is crucial.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Use breakouts to initiate trades, but
      set appropriate stops to manage risk, especially in strong trends where
      pullbacks might be deeper than expected.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Execution:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry Points:</b> </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends:</b> Buy on breakouts or small pullbacks
      with stops below the recent support or the lowest point of the pullback.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends:</b> Sell on breakouts or after small
      rallies with stops above the recent resistance or the highest point of
      the rally.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Management:</b> Adjust stops as trends evolve. For
     instance, raise stops to the last significant low in a bull trend or lower
     them to the last significant high in a bear trend, ensuring you're trading
     with the trend's momentum while protecting gains.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Position Sizing:</b> Trade small when the stop is
     further away to manage risk, particularly in strong trends where the
     market might pull back significantly before continuing the trend.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks emphasizes the importance of understanding market
behavior through price action, focusing on trend classification, and managing
trades with an eye on both risk and probability to maximize profit potential in
day trading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk185533751"><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%'>Exit Plan:&nbsp;</span></u></b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>in the context of this video, in as many words as you
think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader EXITS a
position</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
In Al Brooks' third video on trends, his approach to exiting a position is
deeply integrated with his understanding of price action, trend behavior, and
trader psychology. Here's a detailed discussion on how he recommends traders
exit positions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exit Based on Trend Dynamics:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Confirmation and Reversal:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends:</b> Brooks suggests that in a strong bull
      trend, traders should stay long until there’s a clear indication of a
      trend reversal or significant weakening. He advises against exiting on
      minor pullbacks or reversals that don't break below major higher lows. &quot;You
      stay long until there's a good reason to get out,&quot; he says,
      indicating a strategic patience in holding positions.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends:</b> Similarly, in bear trends, he
      recommends staying short until there's a strong signal of a bull
      reversal, particularly if the market hasn't shown a significant breakout
      to the upside.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Failures:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks warns about the potential for breakouts to fail,
      which he calls traps. If a breakout you've traded on shows signs of
      failing (like not being supported by subsequent price action or volume),
      it might be time to consider an exit. This is particularly relevant when
      the market moves back into a previous range or channel after an initial
      breakout.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Using Stops Strategically:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Loss Placement:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>He emphasizes the importance of using appropriate stops,
      especially in strong trends where pullbacks can be deeper than expected.
      &quot;Experienced traders use the appropriate stop and trade small in
      strong trends,&quot; he mentions. This means setting stops below major
      support in bull trends or above significant resistance in bear trends,
      not just at the last minor low or high.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Moving Stops:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>As the market moves in your favor, Brooks advocates for
      moving your stop to new levels that protect your gains. For example, in a
      bull trend, after a strong breakout, he suggests moving your stop from
      below the previous higher low to below the new higher low formed by the
      breakout.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exit Signals from Price Action:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bar Closure and Momentum:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>If the urgency of buying or selling, which is evident in
      bars closing near their highs or lows, starts to wane, it might be time
      to exit. In a bull trend, if bars start closing lower in their range or
      with longer tails indicating selling pressure, consider an exit. The
      reverse applies in bear trends.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pullback Depth:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>In trends with small pullbacks, Brooks implies that
      deeper pullbacks than usual could signal a possible trend end or
      reversal. If you're in a position and see pullbacks that violate the
      trend's pattern, it might be wise to exit or at least tighten your stop.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Aspects of Exiting:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=7 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding Traps:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks highlights how beginners often exit good trades
      too early due to fear or exit bad trades late due to hope. He advises
      traders to focus on the probability of the trend continuing rather than
      the fear of small losses. If you've entered based on a strong trend
      signal, don't exit prematurely unless the market signals a true reversal.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discipline in Holding:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>He stresses the importance of discipline in holding
      positions that align with the trend. Exiting should be based on market
      signals, not on emotional responses to temporary adverse movements.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Managing Exits in Channels:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=9 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Breakouts:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>For trades within channels, exits might be triggered by a
      breakout in either direction. If you're trading within a channel and the
      price breaks out, Brooks suggests exiting if you're on the wrong side of
      the breakout, especially if the breakout shows strong momentum.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Reversals:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>If a channel starts showing signs of becoming a trend
      reversal (like a bear channel breaking out bullishly or vice versa), this
      could be an exit signal for the current position and potentially an entry
      for the opposite trade.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, Brooks' exit strategy revolves around
recognizing the strength, continuation, or reversal of trends through price
action analysis, using stops intelligently, understanding the psychological
traps of trading, and being disciplined about when to exit based on market
signals rather than emotions. His approach is to stay in trades as long as the
trend supports it, exiting when there's clear evidence of a change in market
behavior or when the risk-reward ratio no longer favors holding the position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Grok's
350 word Executive Summary of the Video</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Now give me your executive summary of the video in 350
words”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
In this video, Al Brooks discusses key aspects of trading trends, focusing on
how traders can interpret and capitalize on market movements. He begins by
classifying trends into two main types: breakouts and channels. <b>Breakouts</b>
are characterized by strong directional moves where every trend bar signifies a
breakout, showing urgency in buying or selling as soon as a bar closes. Brooks
highlights bull and bear breakouts, where bull breakouts are marked by bars
closing near their highs with minimal overlap, and bear breakouts similarly
show relentless selling with bars closing near their lows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Channels</b>, on the other hand, represent a weaker trend
where the market oscillates within a price range, indicating two-sided trading
with alternating control by bulls and bears. These can include rising or
falling wedges, where breakouts from these channels can signal a continuation
or reversal of the trend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks also addresses the pitfalls of <b>traps</b>, where
inexperienced traders might get trapped into unprofitable positions by focusing
too much on risk rather than probability. In strong bull trends, beginners
might wrongly sell expecting a reversal, and vice versa in bear trends, leading
to consistent small losses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He advises traders to buy in bull trends even if the setups
don't look perfect, using appropriate stop levels to manage risk, and to avoid
selling in these conditions due to low probability. In bear trends, the
strategy involves selling short on any indication of continued downward
momentum, again with stops set to accommodate potential pullbacks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The video concludes with the concept of channels as
potential flags for future breakouts, stating that most bull channels lead to
bear breakouts (75% likelihood) and vice versa, advising traders to anticipate
these movements. Brooks emphasizes understanding the behavior of trends,
managing stops wisely, and focusing on probability alongside risk to trade
effectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks
Speaks:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>are you able to look through the transcript at the
references to the specific examples brooks makes, and talk about what he talks
about, how it relates to the context of the whole video--specific to his point
or broader...?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here's an analysis of specific examples Al Brooks mentions in the transcript,
relating them to the broader context of his video on trends:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. Rising Wedge Channel and Falling Channel (01:24)</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion:</b> Brooks introduces the concept of
     channels with examples of a rising wedge and a falling channel, both forms
     of wedges. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Contextual Relevance:</b> These examples are
     foundational in understanding that trends can either be strong (breakouts)
     or weaker (channels). They set the stage for explaining how to identify
     and trade within or against these patterns, aligning with his broader
     point about trend classification.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Gap Open and Bull Trend Bars (03:10)</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion:</b> He describes a scenario where there's a
     gap down at the open, followed by a series of bull trend bars closing on
     their highs with minimal overlap, signaling strong buying urgency.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Contextual Relevance:</b> This example illustrates how
     trends can begin with dramatic moves, emphasizing the importance of
     recognizing urgency in price movements as part of understanding breakouts.
     It ties into his discussion on how to detect and trade real versus false
     breakouts.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Strong Bull Reversal (03:56)</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion:</b> Brooks points out a situation where
     there's a strong reversal up after a gap down, with the subsequent bars
     not falling below the close of the preceding bull bar, indicating strong
     bullish momentum.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Contextual Relevance:</b> This example expands on how
     traders can interpret market behavior for entry points, reinforcing his
     teaching on trend dynamics and the significance of bar closures in trend
     analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4. Bear Trend with Relentless Selling (04:56)</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion:</b> He describes a bear trend where there's
     relentless selling, with bars closing near their lows and little overlap,
     showing strong bearish momentum.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Contextual Relevance:</b> This example is crucial for
     understanding bear trends, particularly how to spot and trade them,
     complementing his broader lesson on recognizing the strength of trends
     through price action.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5. Small Breakout Leading to Big Trend (05:51)</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion:</b> Brooks uses the example of the EUR/USD
     on a 10-minute chart to show how even small breakouts can lead to
     significant trends, especially when viewed on higher time frames.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Contextual Relevance:</b> This example serves to
     illustrate that all trends start with breakouts, no matter how small, and
     underscores the importance of not dismissing minor price movements,
     aligning with his advice on probability over just risk.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>6. Endless Pullback and Bear Breakout (06:42)</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion:</b> He talks about an &quot;endless
     pullback&quot; where the market keeps trending down, eventually leading to
     a bear breakout, which then becomes a measuring gap.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Contextual Relevance:</b> This is a direct lesson on
     how pullbacks within trends can signal further movement in the trend's
     direction, teaching traders patience and the recognition of trend
     continuation patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>7. Spike and Channel Patterns (09:20)</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion:</b> Brooks refers to various scenarios
     where a spike (strong breakout) is followed by a channel, explaining how
     this pattern is common across all trends.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Contextual Relevance:</b> This example is central to
     understanding trend evolution, from breakouts to consolidations,
     reflecting his broader point about the cyclical nature of market trends
     and how traders should adjust their strategies accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>8. Trend from the Open and Trading Range Days (10:08)</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discussion:</b> He discusses how a trend might start
     right from the market open, leading to either a straightforward trend or a
     day characterized by trading ranges within a trend.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Contextual Relevance:</b> This example introduces the
     concept of daily market behavior, encouraging traders to be agile in
     recognizing whether the day's structure will support trend following or
     range trading, which is part of his broader lesson on adapting to market
     conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of these examples serves to illustrate Brooks' key
points about trend analysis, breakout recognition, channel trading, and the
psychological aspects of trading (like avoiding traps by understanding market
probability). They collectively support his teaching on how to interpret price
action for effective day trading, emphasizing both strategic and tactical
approaches to market trends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks
Speaks Specifically:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>what quotation pointers can you find from brooks about
the trading calculation and behaviour from traders? Examples such as &quot;when
the market come to the middle 1/3 of the channel bulls buy again&quot; type
thing</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here are some quotation pointers from Al Brooks' discussion in the video that
relate to trading calculations and trader behavior:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Every trend bar is a breakout.&quot;</b> - Brooks
     emphasizes that every bar in a trending move represents a breakout,
     highlighting the importance of recognizing these movements for trading.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;A channel is a weaker type of trend in which
     there is two-sided trading.&quot;</b> - This quote points to the nature of
     channels where both bulls and bears participate, suggesting a more
     cautious approach to trading within these phases.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Every trend is either a breakout or a
     channel.&quot;</b> - Simplifies the trading calculation into two primary
     scenarios that traders should be prepared for.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Beginners only think about risk and therefore
     they end up only selling when the market's in a bull trend because the
     risk is small.&quot;</b> - Brooks critiques how beginners focus too much
     on risk, leading to counterproductive trading behavior in strong trends.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;And they totally ignore probability. And they end
     up losing money because the probability is too low to be able to trade
     profitably.&quot;</b> - This underscores the need for traders to consider
     both risk and probability in their trading decisions.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Once you think the trend is up, don't get trapped
     into repeated shorts.&quot;</b> - A practical guide on trader behavior,
     warning against fighting the trend which can lead to being
     &quot;trapped&quot; in unprofitable positions.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;In a strong bear trend, the signal bars rarely
     look good.&quot;</b> - Brooks points out that in strong trends, entry
     signals might not look perfect, but the probability of the trend
     continuing is high, influencing how traders should interpret and act on
     these signals.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;75% chance you're going to get a break above this
     trend line.&quot;</b> - Brooks gives specific probabilities for channel
     breakouts, offering traders a framework for decision-making based on
     statistical likelihood.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;I think of every bear channel as a bull
     flag.&quot;</b> - This quote provides a behavioral insight into how
     traders should view channels, anticipating potential breakouts.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Every bull channel is a bear flag 75 chance
     there'll be a bear breakout.&quot;</b> - Similarly, this quote prepares
     traders for the likelihood of a reversal or correction, influencing their
     position management within channels.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>These quotations provide direct insights into Brooks'
philosophy on trading calculations (like understanding breakouts, channels, and
probabilities) and trader behavior (focusing on the right aspects of the market
movement, avoiding traps, and not fighting the trend). They are indicative of
his approach to teaching traders how to think about the market's behavior and
how to react strategically.</p>

(contrast, list, whatever) between tactics and strategy in regards to the
content of this video?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Certainly! Here's a structured comparison between tactics and strategy
specifically tailored to Al Brooks' content from the third of five videos on
trends, using his examples, statements, and quips:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics vs. Strategy in Al Brooks' Trading Philosophy for
the Third Video on Trends:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Bar Analysis:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Observing each trend bar as a breakout for
      immediate trading actions, like entering or adjusting positions.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quip:</b> &quot;Every trend bar is a breakout.&quot; -
      Indicates the tactical importance of each bar in a trend.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Urgency in Trading:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Acting on the urgency of buying or selling
      right after a bar's close, especially in strong trends or after
      breakouts.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example:</b> &quot;As soon as this bar closed, a lot
      of traders just hit the button to buy the market.&quot; - Tactical
      decision-making based on immediate price action.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Loss Management:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Setting stops with an understanding of the
      trend's strength, particularly in scenarios where pullbacks might occur.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Statement:</b> &quot;Experienced traders use the
      appropriate stop and trade small in strong trends.&quot; - Tactical risk
      control in response to market momentum.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Confirmation:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Confirming breakouts through the behavior
      of subsequent bars, looking for follow-through or lack thereof.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example:</b> &quot;A breakout... can be a single bar,
      it can be a series of bars.&quot; - Tactical entry on confirmed breakout
      patterns.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pullback Trading:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Buying pullbacks in bull trends or selling
      on rallies in bear trends, focusing on the probability of the trend
      continuing.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Insight:</b> &quot;As soon as this bar closed,
      traders did not place a limit order to buy the close as soon as the bar
      closed by the market.&quot; - Tactical patience for better entry points.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Classification:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Classifying trends into breakout or
      channel phases to dictate the overall trading strategy for the day or
      session.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quip:</b> &quot;Every trend is either a breakout or a
      channel.&quot; - Strategic framework for market analysis.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Alignment:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Staying with the trend, avoiding
      counter-trend trades unless there's clear evidence of a reversal or trend
      exhaustion.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Philosophy:</b> &quot;Once you think the trend is up,
      don't get trapped into repeated shorts.&quot; - Strategic alignment with
      market directionality.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability-Based Trading:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Emphasizing the probability of a trade's
      success over just managing risk, acknowledging that low-risk trades often
      come with low probability.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight:</b> &quot;Beginners only think about risk...
      And they totally ignore probability.&quot; - Strategic focus on likely
      outcomes.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Behavior Anticipation:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Understanding that channels can lead to
      breakouts or form trading ranges, preparing for different scenarios.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Rule:</b> &quot;75% chance you're going to get
      a break above this trend line.&quot; - Strategic anticipation of channel
      dynamics.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Trading:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Developing the discipline to trade based
      on market trends rather than reacting to every minor fluctuation or
      fearing losses.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example:</b> &quot;Beginners, they love to sell bull
      trends... They're always looking for reasons to sell.&quot; - Encourages
      strategic patience and trend respect.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Contrast:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics</b> are about the immediate actions taken in
     response to market conditions, such as deciding on entry and exit based on
     bar-by-bar analysis, managing stops, and reacting to trend signals or
     pullbacks.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b> deals with the broader approach,
     understanding market phases (breakout vs. channel), focusing on trends'
     direction and persistence, and managing trades based on probability rather
     than just risk. Brooks' strategy in this video involves recognizing the trend's
     nature and adapting tactics accordingly, ensuring that short-term actions
     serve long-term market understanding.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>This video specifically teaches traders to blend tactical
precision with strategic foresight, where tactics execute the strategy informed
by a nuanced understanding of trend behavior and market psychology.</p>

Notes on Video</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Overview</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Educational Presentation meeting titled &quot;14 C
Trends&quot; focused on understanding various types of market trends and their
behaviors. Key discussions highlighted that trends can be in a breakout phase,
characterized by strong price movements, or a channel phase, which indicates
weaker trading with two-sided price action. Participants learned that small
breakouts can be the foundation for larger trends, while endless pullbacks can
signal potential reversals. The session also emphasized the similarity in trend
behavior across different time frames and the critical distinction between bull
and bear trends, with guidelines for traders on avoiding common pitfalls.
Noteworthy was the statistic that bear channels have a 75% chance of
experiencing a bull breakout, and vice versa for bull channels. The meeting
underscored the importance of classifying trends to inform trading strategies
effectively.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Classification:</b> Both summaries highlight
     Brooks' emphasis on understanding trends as either breakouts or channels,
     which is central to his teaching methodology.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull and Bear Dynamics:</b> We both acknowledge Brooks'
     discussion on how bull and bear trends work, including his insights on
     small pullbacks in bull trends being particularly strong.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Traps vs. Breakouts:</b> There's a mutual recognition
     of Brooks' warnings about traders getting trapped by focusing only on
     risk, not probability, and his advice on dealing with breakouts.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Behavior:</b> Both summaries note Brooks'
     explanations about how channels can lead to breakouts or form trading
     ranges, with specific probabilities of direction changes.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Differences:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Narrative vs. List Structure:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai:</b> Provides a detailed, segmented list
      of topics and examples with timestamps, which is excellent for a
      comprehensive review but might miss the strategic narrative.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary:</b> Focuses on a narrative that links
      these concepts to actionable trading strategies, emphasizing what Brooks
      teaches about market behavior and trader psychology.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Highlighting Key Strategies:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai:</b> Lists out points without much
      prioritization, giving equal weight to all aspects.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary:</b> I aim to spotlight the strategic
      essence of Brooks' teaching:</li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability and Risk:</b> Brooks' critique of
       beginners' focus on risk, &quot;Beginners only think about risk and
       therefore they end up only selling when the market's in a bull trend
       because the risk is small.&quot;</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Recognition:</b> His foundational statement,
       &quot;Every trend bar is a breakout.&quot;, guides traders to always
       look for breakout opportunities.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Trading:</b> The notion that &quot;Channels
       are weaker trends with two-sided trading&quot; informs traders how to
       approach these market phases.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Emphasis on Examples for Learning:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai:</b> Lists examples but doesn't deeply

</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategically Placed Quotations by Brooks:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Breakouts:</b> &quot;Every trend bar is a
     breakout.&quot; - This quote encapsulates Brooks' view that recognizing
     breakouts is crucial for entering trades.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Channels:</b> &quot;A channel is a weaker type of
     trend in which there is two-sided trading.&quot; - Helps traders
     understand the nature of trading within channels, which is key for timing
     entries and exits.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Probability vs. Risk:</b> &quot;Beginners only think
     about risk and therefore they end up only selling when the market's in a
     bull trend because the risk is small. And they totally ignore
     probability.&quot; - This is a pivotal lesson on trading psychology and
     strategy, urging traders to balance risk with probability.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Trend Behavior:</b> &quot;In a strong bear trend,
     the signal bars rarely look good.&quot; - Advises traders not to wait for
     perfect setups in strong trends but to act on the probability of trend
     continuation.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Channel Breakouts:</b> &quot;75% chance you're going
     to get a break above this trend line.&quot; - Provides traders with
     concrete probabilities to base their expectations on, enhancing
     decision-making in channel trading scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What's Salient Through Brooks' Lens:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Momentum Recognition:</b> Brooks emphasizes the urgency
     and momentum behind price movements, which is key for both entry and exit
     decisions.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding Common Mistakes:</b> His quips about
     beginners' trading habits serve as cautionary tales to focus on the
     trend's direction and probability.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategic Trading:</b> By providing examples of market
     behavior, Brooks teaches traders to adapt their strategies based on the
     current market phase (breakout or channel).</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In essence, my summary aims to extract and emphasize Brooks'
strategic teachings, using his direct quotes to illustrate how these concepts
should influence trading behavior, while Fireflies.ai's approach is more about
cataloging the content. Both approaches have value, but for tactical trading
insights, focusing on Brooks' key quotes and their implications is crucial.</p>

Talk: chosen indicator in video’s Context</span></u></b><i> </i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>what would be the most apropos indicator to use for this
video's content when using it to guide day trading decisions?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><s>Volume Profile</s> MACD</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“describe to me how the MACD works and how to use it or
interpret it using the al brooks stuff above</i>”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><br>
How MACD Works:</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a
trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two
moving averages of a security's price. Here's how it functions:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Components:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>MACD Line: Calculated as the difference between a
      12-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and a 26-period EMA. This line
      represents short-term momentum relative to the longer-term trend.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Signal Line: Typically a 9-period EMA of the MACD line,
      which smoothens the MACD line to produce trading signals.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>MACD Histogram: Shows the difference between the MACD
      line and the signal line. It's useful for spotting changes in momentum.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Basic Interpretation:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Crossovers: </li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal>Bullish Crossover: When the MACD line crosses above the
       signal line, it indicates increasing bullish momentum, suggesting a
       potential buy signal.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>Bearish Crossover: When the MACD line crosses below the
       signal line, it signals increasing bearish momentum, suggesting a
       potential sell signal.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Divergence: If the price makes a new high or low that
      isn't confirmed by the MACD, this divergence can signal a potential
      reversal or weakening of the current trend.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Histogram: The histogram's height indicates the distance
      between the MACD and signal lines. Increasing height shows strengthening
      momentum, while decreasing height indicates waning momentum.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using and Interpreting MACD with Al Brooks' Methodology:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trend Confirmation:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Trend Direction: Brooks emphasizes understanding the
      trend's direction. MACD can help confirm if the price action you're
      observing aligns with a continuing trend. A rising MACD line in a bull
      trend or falling in a bear trend can confirm Brooks' observations about
      trend behavior.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Breakout Confirmation: When Brooks discusses breakouts,
      look for the MACD to confirm these moves. A breakout accompanied by a
      bullish MACD crossover or an expanding histogram can indicate genuine
      momentum behind the price move, suggesting it's not just a trap.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Momentum and Entry Points:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Entry Signals: Use bullish crossovers to enter long
      positions during what Brooks might describe as a bull breakout or after a
      small pullback in a bull trend. Conversely, bearish crossovers can be
      used for short entries in bear trends or after small rallies in a bear
      trend.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Momentum Shifts: Brooks warns about getting trapped into
      bad trades; watching for changes in the MACD histogram can help. If the
      histogram starts to decrease after a strong move, it might signal that
      the momentum is waning, aligning with Brooks' advice on avoiding trades
      where probability is low.</li>
 </ul>

  <li class=MsoNormal>Divergence: Brooks discusses how beginners can get
      trapped by focusing on risk rather than probability. MACD divergence can
      be a tool to avoid such traps. If the price is setting new highs but the
      MACD isn't, or vice versa, it might indicate a trap or an impending
      reversal, encouraging caution or reconsideration of current positions.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Exiting Trades:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Exit Points: When Brooks talks about managing trades,
      especially in strong trends, the MACD can guide when to take profits or
      tighten stops. A bearish crossover in a bull trend might suggest it's
      time to secure gains or at least reassess the position, especially if
      you're in a trade based on a breakout or trend continuation.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Channel Trading:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Although MACD isn't directly used for channel
      identification, in channel phases described by Brooks, watch for the MACD
      to oscillate around zero or to move in tandem with price within the
      channel. A significant move away from zero could signal an upcoming
      breakout from the channel.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>By combining Brooks' price action strategies with MACD,
traders can enhance their analysis by adding a layer of momentum confirmation
to their trading decisions, helping to filter noise and focus on moves with
real momentum behind them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is Al Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you for watching the Brooks
training course.&nbsp;This is the third of five videos on trends.&nbsp;I'm
going to begin by talking about the different types of trends.&nbsp;And then
I'm going to be talking about the bull and bear versions of the
trends.&nbsp;And finally I'm going to be talking about traps and
breakouts.&nbsp;Traps are failed breakouts.&nbsp;Trends are important because
they offer a lot of profit opportunity.&nbsp;But traders need to understand how
they operate.&nbsp;And for me a good starting point is classifying them into
different types of trends based upon their behavior.&nbsp;Every trend bar is a
breakout.&nbsp;Every series of trend bars is a breakout.&nbsp;So bull breakouts
here, bear breakout there, bear breakout here.&nbsp;And every trend is also contained
within a channel, although the channel sometimes is not particularly
obvious.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>01:24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have a rising wedge channel and we have a falling
channel that is also a wedge channel.&nbsp;A breakout.&nbsp;It can be a single
bar, it can be a series of bars.&nbsp;Trends are either in a breakout phase or
a channel phase.&nbsp;And a breakout is the strongest type of a trend.&nbsp;I
sometimes call it a spike.&nbsp;So I would call this a spike.&nbsp;And channel
will trend.&nbsp;And every trend bar is also a climax.&nbsp;Climax does not
mean the trend reverses or the trend even pauses.&nbsp;Sometimes the climax
just gets more climactic and the market just keeps going up.&nbsp;Every trend
is either a breakout or a channel.&nbsp;A channel is a weaker type of trend in
which there is two sided trading.&nbsp;So you get bulls in control for part of
it, pairs in control or another part of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>02:22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the way you draw channels, it's rarely perfect.&nbsp;The
lines are really perfectly corresponding to the points in the
channel.&nbsp;Every trend begins with a breakup, at least a small
breakup.&nbsp;Here we have a gap open, so here's the end of one session, the
start of another session, and we have a big gap down and the gap immediately
closed.&nbsp;The market had a series of bull trend bars closing on their
highs.&nbsp;Not much overlap between the bars.&nbsp;As soon as this bar closed,
a lot of traders just hit the button to buy the market and you can see the
over.&nbsp;The next bar did not fall below the close of this bar.&nbsp;And the
same thing here.&nbsp;There's a lot of urgency on the part of the bulls in this
particular breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>03:10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as this bar closed, traders did not place a limit
order to buy the close as soon as the bar closed by the market.&nbsp;And so the
low and open of this bar never fell below that close.&nbsp;So this is a strong
reversal up.&nbsp;And every trend bar or series of trend bars is a Breakout
does not matter that you do not see the breakout or understand what the
breakout is.&nbsp;But that's how you have to think of it.&nbsp;You can think of
this as a very steep bear trend and we broke above it.&nbsp;So I could draw a
trend line from this high to this high.&nbsp;And we're breaking above it, a
series of bull trend bars.&nbsp;Good sized bodies closing in their upper
halves.&nbsp;Here they're closing near their highs.&nbsp;And it could be one
bar, it could be many bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>03:56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We gap down, which is a bear breakout.&nbsp;And then we
reverse up bull breakout.&nbsp;This is a very strong breakout.&nbsp;Very strong
bull bars.&nbsp;No tails on the bottom, closes on the high, very small tails on
top.&nbsp;Sometimes a breakout is made up of less impressive trend
bars.&nbsp;For example, we have a breakout here and another breakout
here.&nbsp;And this one contained a doji small bar closing around its
middle.&nbsp;And this one had a doi here and again here.&nbsp;It's not as
strong as the other one, but it's still a breakout and it's still a strong bull
trend.&nbsp;You want to see most of the bull bars closing at least above their
midpoints, preferably at their highs.&nbsp;And it's stronger yet if there's
very little pullback below the close of the prior bar.&nbsp;Very little
overlap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>04:56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most bear trends begin with some kind of a
breakout.&nbsp;Here we've got a breakout.&nbsp;We have another breakout
here.&nbsp;Look at this bear trend.&nbsp;It's mostly beer bars closing below
their midpoints or near their lows.&nbsp;And we have several series of
consecutive bear trend bars.&nbsp;So that's relentless selling.&nbsp;And look
at this bar.&nbsp;As soon as it closed, traders hit the button.&nbsp;Sell, sell
the market.&nbsp;Look at the open and high of this bar.&nbsp;Did not get above
that close.&nbsp;So this urgency all the way down.&nbsp;Very little overlap,
very little overlap.&nbsp;And that increases the chances that the market will
go lower.&nbsp;Sometimes a small breakout can lead to a big trend.&nbsp;This is
the Euro versus a dollar, a ten minute chart.&nbsp;Now look at this.&nbsp;This
time on the bottom.&nbsp;This is a 10 minute chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>05:51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there's price on the vertical axis.&nbsp;It's a two
dimensional chart.&nbsp;Price and time.&nbsp;It's easy to think that breakouts
have to begin with price.&nbsp;Only a big move in price.&nbsp;Well, they
don't.&nbsp;Breakouts can take place over time made up of lots of small bars,
as is the case here.&nbsp;After 20 or 30 bars you have to conclude that even
though we're not getting huge bars, it's still a bear trend.&nbsp;Look how
tight the channel is.&nbsp;Look how small the pullbacks are.&nbsp;They do not
go up very far.&nbsp;They only last one, two or three bars.&nbsp;And on a
higher time frame chart.&nbsp;This is a strong breakout.&nbsp;We have a little
breakout here.&nbsp;A gap between this high follow through bar and this
low.&nbsp;The bar before this small breakout bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>06:42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can get a small breakout and it can lead to a relentless
trend that can go on a long time and channel.&nbsp;Here the channel is maybe 30
bars without a pullback.&nbsp;Whenever you see an endless pullback like this,
we have a bull trend.&nbsp;And initially the bull saw it as a pullback, yet
it's a never ending pullback.&nbsp;It's an endless pullback and once you get 20
or 30 bars down, you have to be thinking at some point the bulls give up and
you can get a big bear breakout.&nbsp;That becomes a measuring gap.&nbsp;At
least true measure move.&nbsp;Down here, the bulls finally gave up.&nbsp;So
it's no longer a beer channel bull flag, it's now a bear trend.&nbsp;We have a
big breakout bar and a big follow through bar.&nbsp;Typically that's what
happens when you have an endless pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>07:34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And finally the bulls give up.&nbsp;Usually you get a pair
of big bear bars closing near their lows and it usually becomes a measuring gap
and the market typically falls for a measured move.&nbsp;Down here we have what
the bulls think is the bull flag, but it just keeps growing and
growing.&nbsp;And then we have a breakout below the bottom of what was a bull
flag.&nbsp;And the market fell for about a measurement down was no longer a
bull flag.&nbsp;Once these two bars come, and now everyone concludes that it's
a severe trend and it probably will fall further and this probably will end up
as a measuring gap.&nbsp;There are many different types of trends and they
behave differently.&nbsp;So it's good to distinguish the differences among the
different trends because you trade them slightly differently.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>08:24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In general, especially if you're starting out, it's better
to only swing trade once you think the market is going up.&nbsp;Here we got a
bull breakout and small double bottom.&nbsp;This bar, that bar, a bullet
close.&nbsp;So you buy there and you stay long until there's a good reason to
get out.&nbsp;And this is not a good reason.&nbsp;Neither is this triangle
three pushes up 1, 2, 3.&nbsp;And these reversals are not strong enough for the
bears to take control.&nbsp;So the both hold.&nbsp;You need a good reason to
exit, and these are not good reasons to exit.&nbsp;Trends behave the same on
all time frames and it doesn't matter what time frame you're using on intraday
charts.&nbsp;I use some names that are different, but there are corresponding
types on the daily chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>09:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So sometimes if we gap down here and just started trending
up from the open, I would call it a trend from the open bull trend on a daily
chart.&nbsp;Instead, I would probably just call it a tight bull
channel.&nbsp;And if this were a 5 minute chart and this was the open of the
day, I would just call it a trend for the open bull trend or possibly a small
pullback.&nbsp;Bullshit.&nbsp;Now look at this chart.&nbsp;We have a spike
pullback and you call the whole thing a channel or you call it another spike and
channel or another spike and channel.&nbsp;And just about every trend at some
point has a spike and channel pattern as a breakout and then a channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10:08</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If this is a gap down open or if this is the open of the day
and we did this, you could call it a trend from the open bull trend.&nbsp;It's
clearly the spike and channel bull trend.&nbsp;And again, almost all trends
have some component of a spike and channel to them.&nbsp;But if this is a trend
from the open bull trend, they happen about once a week on an intraday
chart.&nbsp;It could also be a trending trading range day where the market
breaks out and then forms a big trading range.&nbsp;Although in this case it
has not yet formed a trading range.&nbsp;You can argue there's a trading range
here, trading range there, and it's a trending trading range
day.&nbsp;Typically a trending trading range day just has a couple trading
ranges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10:49</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if you start to get four trading ranges like this, I
don't use that term trending trading range day.&nbsp;Instead I would call it a
spiking channel bull trend.&nbsp;I would call it a trend from the open bull
trend.&nbsp;If this is the open, it clearly trended from the open.&nbsp;And I
would also call it a spike and channel bull trend where this is a spike and
then channel made another spike within this channel on another channel.&nbsp;Is
it a broad bull channel?&nbsp;Well, it's fairly broad, so you can also call it
a broad bull channel.&nbsp;And there are other types of bright bull channels
like wedges and stairs.&nbsp;If it's a small pullback bull trend, this is
really not a good example because the pullbacks are too deep.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11:33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Small pullback bull trends are the strongest types of bull
trends and they occur a couple times a month.&nbsp;This is I think more of a
spiking channel bull trend spike here, or you can say the whole thing is a
spike and then shrink the channel up.&nbsp;And I would not call it the trending
trading range today.&nbsp;It's also a broad channel, the pullbacks are fairly
deep and it spends a lot of time going sideways.&nbsp;That's characteristic of
a broad channel.&nbsp;On the downside, we have a bear breakout and then a
channel compare breakout pullback here, bigger pullback here and then a channel
again.&nbsp;Most bear trends have a spike in channel bear trends within
them.&nbsp;If this is the open of the day, then it's also a trend from the open
bear trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here we have a trend and a trading range and the bear
trend resumed.&nbsp;It's also a trend resumption bear trend.&nbsp;All bear
trends have a spike in channel component.&nbsp;Is this trending trading range
day?&nbsp;Not really.&nbsp;We only have one trading range.&nbsp;We have a
breakout did not form a second trading range.&nbsp;Is it a broad bear
channel?&nbsp;Well, not really.&nbsp;You can argue that this is a broad bear
channel.&nbsp;But to me this is more of a strong breakout trading range and another
strong breakdown.&nbsp;Is there a small pullback bull trend?&nbsp;No, this
pullback is too deep for this to be a small pullback full time.&nbsp;I would
call this a spike and channel bear trend.&nbsp;If you want, you can call it a
trend resumption bear trend.&nbsp;Let me talk a little bit more about bull and
bear trends.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13:14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many ways to classify trends, but usually one is
the dominant type on the chart.&nbsp;If this is the open of the day, you've got
a spike in channel bull trend.&nbsp;You can call the trend from the open bull
trend.&nbsp;You can call it a tight bullshit.&nbsp;That is pretty
tight.&nbsp;You can also call it a trending trading range day.&nbsp;We have a
trading range, a brief breakout and another trading range.&nbsp;The pullback
overlapped the lower range and then we resumed up again.&nbsp;All trends begin
with some kind of a breakout and then it has a pullback here.&nbsp;Or you can
call this whole thing a pullback and then you get a channel.&nbsp;So here we
have a breakout, a spike and then we have a channel.&nbsp;And again, sometimes
it's not obvious what the channel is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13:58</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did the channel begin here to begin here?&nbsp;Did it begin
there?&nbsp;Doesn't matter.&nbsp;Some computers will use any of
those.&nbsp;Three beer trends also usually can be classified more than one
way.&nbsp;This is a good example of a small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;If this
is the open of the day, it's a trend from the open bear trend.&nbsp;Very tight
channel here.&nbsp;So it's a breakout on a higher time frame.&nbsp;It's a spike
in channel bear trend.&nbsp;Look at the pullbacks.&nbsp;They only last a bar or
two and the market just continues down in a very tight channel.&nbsp;So it's a
tight bear channel and it's also A I think a small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;I
would call this a small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;All the pullbacks are really
small.&nbsp;It's the strongest type of bear trend on a higher time frame
chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14:49</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This entire sell off is a breakout, a bear breakout again, a
bear micro channel lasting about 10 bars or so.&nbsp;It's a breakout on a
higher time frame chart.&nbsp;It's a spike and then we have a pullback and then
a channel.&nbsp;So it's a type of spike and channel bear trend.&nbsp;And all
trends have some component of spiking channel bear trend to them.&nbsp;But this
is mostly a small pullback bear trend and it's better to only short.&nbsp;I
want to talk a little bit about getting trapped into bad trades, getting
trapped out of good trades.&nbsp;Talk a little bit about breakouts as
well.&nbsp;At some point you look at this and say, it's a bull trend,
right?&nbsp;So if it's a bull trend, don't sell, don't be selling highs, don't
be selling reversals down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15:44</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Especially a trend like this where the pullbacks are so
small, so it's really easy to get trapped into shorts you sell and immediately
reverses up, trapping you into a loss.&nbsp;It's also easy to get trapped out
of lungs.&nbsp;You say, well dojis bear bars, it doesn't look all that strong
away for deeper pullback to buy.&nbsp;And the market just keeps going
up.&nbsp;Beginners, they love to sell bull trends.&nbsp;Oh, maybe we're
reversing biclimax.&nbsp;We have a double top here, we have a wedge here, we
have another wedge here.&nbsp;They're always looking for reasons to
sell.&nbsp;And there's only one reason why they are selling.&nbsp;It's because
they are afraid of risk.&nbsp;They equate losing their account with death, the
death of their dream as a trader.&nbsp;And so all they focus on is
risk.&nbsp;They do not focus on probability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16:31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's a terrible mistake because some days are small
pullback bull trends or strong bull trends.&nbsp;And yes, the risk shorting is
low, small.&nbsp;So you sell below this bar and you're not risking much, but
you keep losing.&nbsp;Yes, the risk is low, but the probability is extremely
low.&nbsp;It's impossible to make money or consistent money selling in strong
bull trends.&nbsp;Okay, so beginners keep selling saying, oh, I'm not risking
much selling, not risking much.&nbsp;But all of those small losses add
up.&nbsp;And anytime you're taking a trade with low risk, you also are taking a
trade with low probability.&nbsp;And it's very difficult to make money if the
probability is very low.&nbsp;As it is selling the strong bull trend, you just
keep getting stocked out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17:22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beginners only think about risk and therefore they end up
only selling when the market's in a bull trend because the risk is
small.&nbsp;And they only end up buying in a bear trend because the risk is
small.&nbsp;And they totally ignore probability.&nbsp;And they end up losing
money because the probability is too low to be able to trade
profitably.&nbsp;Once you think the trend is up, don't get trapped into
repeated shorts.&nbsp;Don't be selling.&nbsp;You just keep looking for buy
opportunities.&nbsp;And strong bull trends rarely have good looking buy
opportunities.&nbsp;This is not a good looking high one.&nbsp;Neither is
this.&nbsp;That's not a good looking high.&nbsp;Two, we're going to be reversal
in the doshi.&nbsp;Not good looking, but the single bars, even though they do
not look good, typically they're reliable.&nbsp;The probability is high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18:12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So experts buy and they just decide where the correct stop
is.&nbsp;Bull breakout.&nbsp;Not much of a strong bull breakout here.&nbsp;So
the stop is still down here.&nbsp;So you gotta buy.&nbsp;You gotta allow for
the possibility of a deep pullback.&nbsp;But you have to buy and you just use
the correct stock and trade small.&nbsp;Every time you see the market trying to
resume back up, you buy and the stop is way down here.&nbsp;So you trade
smaller.&nbsp;And then after you get a strong bull breakout like this, then
this becomes a major higher low.&nbsp;You can raise your stock from here up to
there.&nbsp;So when you're buying over here, your stop is now down
here.&nbsp;In beginners, they don't buy because even buying here, for them the
stop is too far.&nbsp;They don't want to risk that much.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19:02</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So they keep shorting where the stock is closer and they
keep losing because the probability is so low.&nbsp;Look at this strong bear
trend.&nbsp;You can only sell, but it's really easy as a beginner to get
trapped into longs.&nbsp;You keep buying, betting that the reversals will give
you at least a scalp.&nbsp;And you're buying because the risk is
small.&nbsp;Maybe you buy above this bar, this bullet side bar for a stop just
below and you say, okay, I got stopped off and did not lose much money.&nbsp;But
if you do it again here and here and here, you end up losing a lot of money, a
lot of small losses and out to a lot of money.&nbsp;And then beginners, they
also get trapped out of taking shorts because they keep waiting for bigger
pullbacks to sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19:51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And they never get short.&nbsp;A strong trend like this
traps beginners into longs.&nbsp;They keep buying because they're concerned
that they don't want to Take trades for the shop is far away and they never
short because they know the stop is way up here and they don't want to risk
that much.&nbsp;Only focusing on risk and ignoring probability, you will lose
money.&nbsp;The trader's equation has three variables.&nbsp;Risk, reward and
probability.&nbsp;Beginners typically only think about risk and they're buying
constantly.&nbsp;Even in a very strong bear trend.&nbsp;They just keep buying
reversals up and they get quickly trapped into zooms back down and eventually
they wipe their account out.&nbsp;In a strong bear trend, the signal bars
rarely look good.&nbsp;You want to sell below that bull bar.&nbsp;Well, it's
not that good looking a shell, but it's a strong bear trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20:50</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of this bull bar small boshy, the cell setups never look
all that good.&nbsp;However, the chance of a reversal up is small.&nbsp;And if
you do get a reversal up, it'll be minor and you'll test back
down.&nbsp;Experienced traders use the appropriate stock sell at any time, any
reason, and they take these sell signals.&nbsp;Even with the bad sell signal
bars, knowing that the odds are if the market goes up, it will not go up that
r.&nbsp;So when you're trading in a strong bear trend and you're looking to
short, you can sell at the market, you can sell the stops.&nbsp;But if you're
taking stop entry shorts, which is fine and most beginners should do that, the
cell setups never look good enough.&nbsp;Yet the market continues down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21:37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The key is using the correct stuff, which means risking more
than you might like to risk.&nbsp;However, that's the only way to trade
this.&nbsp;Use the correct stock and trade very small beginners.&nbsp;They
don't sell because they don't want to use a stop that far away.&nbsp;The risk
is too big.&nbsp;And because they are so afraid of a stock this far away, they
get trapped out of very profitable shorts and they miss the entire
trend.&nbsp;Let's see a bear channel immediately.&nbsp;Bear channel.&nbsp;5%
chance it's going to be a bull breakout.&nbsp;25 chance there'll be a bear
breakout and the trend will accelerate downward.&nbsp;We have a spike down
micro channel or breakout.&nbsp;Higher time frame and then a channel.&nbsp;So
channel usually evolves into a trading range.&nbsp;75 chance you're going to
get a break above this trend line.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think of every bear channel as a bull flag.&nbsp;Even if
it's a bear channel and a bear trend.&nbsp;Because 75 of the time you're going
to get a bull breakdown.&nbsp;Usually not as dramatically bullish as this, but
still 75 of the time a beer channel is a bull flag.&nbsp;You get A full
breakdown.&nbsp;Typically you have a spike in channel bear trend like
this.&nbsp;The spike and channel get the bull breakout.&nbsp;It tests around
the beginning of the channel.&nbsp;Here went quite a bit above.&nbsp;And then
you end up evolving into a trading range.&nbsp;So down and up and then down and
sideways.&nbsp;Then after you have the trading range, the market again decides
on the direction of the breakup, up or down and it can be in either
direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anytime I see a bull channel, I think bear flag 75 chance
you get a bear breakout.&nbsp;Does it become a bear trend?&nbsp;Not
necessarily.&nbsp;It can break out simply by going sideways.&nbsp;But full
channel bear flag 75 chance of a bear breakout.&nbsp;So I always think of every
bull channel as a bear flag expecting a bear breakout and a conversion into a
change, sometimes into a bear trend as it was here.&nbsp;And usually the market
tries to test the beginning of the channel which is down here.&nbsp;And you can
see it fell below the bottom of the channel before the buyers came
back.&nbsp;And so typically you get a bull channel and then a bear breakdown
and a conversion into a trading range.&nbsp;And at that point the market
decides whether to break out again to the upside or to the downside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this video I talked about the types of trends and why
it's important to classify trends into different types because you trade them
differently.&nbsp;And then talk about bull and bear trends.&nbsp;Finally, I
talked about traps and breakouts.&nbsp;How beginners and to get trapped out of
good trades and trapped into bad trades.&nbsp;And I also talked about breakouts
of channels.&nbsp;Every bull channel is a bear flag 75 chance there'll be a
beer breakout.&nbsp;Every bear channel is a bull flag 75 chance there'll be a
bull breakup.&nbsp;I'm Al Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you for watching Brooks Training
course this is the third of five videos on trends.&nbsp;The recording.&nbsp;</p>
