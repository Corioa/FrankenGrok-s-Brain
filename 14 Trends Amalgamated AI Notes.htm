Strategy Amalgamated from 14 A-E Trends Videos:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Amalgamate the following without losing the flavour of
your insights<br>
</i>(And then I listed everyone of Grok’s Strategy from BTC Video AI Notes 14
A-E).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's a comprehensive amalgamation of Al Brooks' price
action trading strategy for day trading, capturing the essence and detailed
nuances from all segments provided:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Al Brooks' Integrated Price Action Trading Strategy for Day
Trading:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Understanding Market Trends and Channels:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trends: The foundation of price movement, with bull trends
     showing higher highs and higher lows, and bear trends displaying lower
     highs and lower lows. Focus is on major trends, typically one or two per
     chart.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Channels: All trends are confined within channels, helping
     visualize potential price movements. Channels can be steep or gradual,
     aiding in setting entry and exit points.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Key Trading Concepts:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Entry Points:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Bull Trends: Buy on pullbacks within the middle third of
      the last rally, where bulls often step in expecting trend continuation.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Bear Trends: Sell on rallies, especially near the
      channel's top or after a failed breakout above a lower high.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Stop Loss Placement:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Bull Trends: Stops just below the most recent major
      higher low.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Bear Trends: Stops just above the most recent major lower
      high.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trend Continuation/Reversal Signals:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Bull Trends: If the market breaks to a new high with
      strong bull bars, raise your stop. If it fails to stay above this high,
      consider exit or reassessment.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Bear Trends: A strong bear breakout below a lower low
      suggests trend persistence; if price action reverses above a prior lower
      low, reassess for potential trend weakening.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Handling Pullbacks and Reversals:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Pullbacks: In trends, pullbacks are opportunities for
     entry or re-entry. For example, in a bull trend, if a reversal attempt
     fails to break below the recent higher low, consider buying.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Reversals: After a failed rally in bear trends, or a
     failed pullback in bull trends, these are spots for selling or buying,
     anticipating the trend's continuation.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trading Ranges vs. Trends:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trading Ranges: When trends weaken, prepare for potential
     trading ranges. Use these to look for breakouts or breakdowns,
     acknowledging the 80% rule where most breakout attempts fail.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Market Open Strategy:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trend from the Open: If there's a gap followed by strong
     directional bars, consider entering in the direction of the gap for long
     positions in a gap up or short in a gap down.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Measured Moves: Calculate potential targets from the
     height of initial breakout bars.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Broad Channels:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Identification: Trends with deep pullbacks forming a
     &quot;stairs pattern&quot;.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Scalping: Trade within these channels by buying at the
     lower third and selling/scalping in the middle third.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Swing Trading: Hold for swings in bear channels, but with
     caution due to potential range expansion.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Psychological Aspects:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Market's Attempt to Reverse: Markets always try to
     reverse, but persistence in higher lows or lower highs within channels
     indicates trend validity.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Patience: Wait for trend confirmations rather than chasing
     trades.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strategic Execution:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Breakouts: Enter on breakouts, especially if confirmed by
     the next bar's close in the direction of the breakout.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Stops and Targets: Use logical stops based on price
     action. For profit-taking, consider measured moves or significant
     support/resistance levels.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trailing Stops: In trends, use trailing stops to capture
     profits while allowing for trend continuation.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Exit Strategy:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trend Exhaustion: Exit on signs of trend weakening or
     reversal, like multiple failed attempts at new highs/lows or significant
     reversal bars.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Dynamic Adjustments: Adjust strategies based on market
     behavior, particularly in late-day dynamics where climactic moves might
     indicate exhaustion.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Risk Management:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Position Sizing: Adjust based on market context and stop
     placement to manage risk effectively.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Daily Loss Limits: Set to prevent significant drawdowns.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, Al Brooks' strategy intertwines technical
analysis with psychological discipline. It emphasizes trading with the market's
flow, using trends and price action signals for entry and exit, managing risk
through strategic stop placement, and maintaining psychological readiness to
adapt to market changes. His approach integrates a deep understanding of market
behavior, advocating for patience, strategic entry/exit points, and adhering to
the market's broader narrative over immediate price movements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Here
are the key points about strategies from the summaries: </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here's the trading strategy based on Al Brooks' methodology from the second set
of summaries:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Al Brooks' Price Action Trading Strategy:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding Trends and Market Context:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Types of Trends</b>: Trends can be either breakouts
     (high-probability movements) or channels (weaker trends with oscillation
     within a price range).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Identification</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends</b>: Look for bullish bars closing near
      their highs, minimal pullbacks, and urgency in buying upon bar closure.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends</b>: Bearish bars closing near their lows,
      with selling urgency post bar closure.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Execution:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry Points</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends</b>: Buy on breakouts or small pullbacks
      within a channel, particularly at or just above the low of the pullback
      bars.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends</b>: Sell on breakouts or minor rallies,
      near or just below the high of these rally bars.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Management</b>: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Place stops below recent support in bull trends or above
      recent resistance in bear trends.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Adjust stops as the trend continues, raising them in bull
      trends to lock in profits or lowering them in bear trends.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Position Sizing</b>: Adjust trade sizes based on market
     volatility and stop placement for effective risk management.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Market Open Strategy:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Assess Initial Move</b>: Use the first 15-30 minutes to
     gauge the day's trend. Look for gaps or strong directional moves to
     indicate the trend from the open.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Measured Moves</b>: Calculate potential targets from
     the height of initial breakout bars.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trading in Channels:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broad Channels</b>: Trade within these by buying at the
     lower third and selling/scalping in the middle third. Be cautious with
     swing trades in bear channels due to potential range expansion.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Aspects:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding Traps</b>: Focus on the probability of trend
     continuation rather than just managing risk to avoid trading against
     strong trends.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Psychology</b>: Understand markets are always trying
     to reverse, but persistence in directional movements indicates trend
     validity.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Daily Loss Limits</b>: Set to prevent significant
     drawdowns.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stops and Targets</b>: Use logical stops based on price
     action for risk management. For profit-taking, consider measured moves or
     significant support/resistance levels.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>General Trading Principles:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Context Over Patterns</b>: Always consider the market's
     context (trend, trading range, channel) before deciding on a trade.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Time Frame Consideration</b>: Validate trend strength
     or potential reversals by also looking at higher time frames.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>This strategy emphasizes reading price action in real-time,
understanding the context of pullbacks within trends, and using this
information to trade in the direction of the trend with disciplined risk
management. Remember, Brooks' methodology underlines the importance of trend
following, patience, and adapting to the market's behavior rather than forcing
trades based on hope or fear.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Analysis and Trading Within Trends:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>All summaries emphasized the importance of identifying
      and trading within the context of trends. Whether it's breakouts or
      channels, understanding the trend's direction is fundamental.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry Points Based on Price Action:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Each summary discussed entering trades on breakouts or
      during pullbacks within trends, particularly in the middle third of
      channels for bull trends or near the high for bear trends.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management Through Stop Placement:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>The consistent advice across summaries was to place stops
      logically based on price action, like below the most recent swing low in
      bull trends or above the swing high in bear trends.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Dynamic Profit Taking:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Using trailing stops or adjusting stop-losses as the
      market moves in your favor to lock in profits while still giving the
      trade room to run was a common strategy.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Psychology:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>The psychological discipline of not trading against the
      trend due to perceived low risk and understanding the market's behavior
      over emotional reactions was a recurring theme.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Points That Stood Out Alone:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Phases and Trend Identification:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>The first summary distinctly highlighted understanding
      market phases (breakouts vs. channels) as a key part of strategy
      formulation, which was less emphasized in others.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Gap and Overlap Analysis:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Unique to one summary, there was a focus on how gaps and
      overlaps in price action could signal trend strength or potential
      reversal, providing a nuanced approach to entry and exit points.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Time Frame Consideration:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Only one summary mentioned the importance of considering
      higher time frames for trend validation, adding a dimension of checking
      trend strength across different time scales.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pre-Market Analysis:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>This was highlighted in one summary as a preparatory step
      for day trading, suggesting traders should analyze the previous day's
      chart and early morning market sentiment to set up their strategy, which
      isn't as pronounced elsewhere.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Discipline in Trade Execution:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>While psychological aspects were discussed, the fourth
      summary uniquely emphasized how psychological discipline should influence
      not just exits but the entire execution of trades, suggesting a deeper
      integration of psychology into trading decisions.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding Traps and Trading with Probability:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>This concept was distinctly articulated in one summary,
      focusing on the probability of trend continuation over just managing
      risk, illustrating a strategic approach to avoid trading against the
      trend due to low-risk perception.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, while the core strategies of trend analysis,
strategic entry points, risk management, and psychological discipline overlap
heavily, each summary brings unique insights or emphasis on specific aspects
like market phases, pre-market analysis, or time frame considerations,
enriching the overall trading strategy with additional layers of thought and
preparation.</p>

Plan Amalgamation from 14 A-E Trends Videos:&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>in the context of this video, in as many words as you
think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader EXITS a
position</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here is an amalgamated summary that blends the insights from all previous
segments, maintaining the flavor of Al Brooks' teachings on how to exit
positions while enhancing the narrative with additional nuances:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Al Brooks' Comprehensive Exit Strategy:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Market Context and Trend Dynamics:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exit Strategy in Trends:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>In bull trends, Brooks advises staying long until there's
      a clear indication of trend exhaustion or a reversal. He stresses not
      exiting on minor pullbacks or reversals unless they break significant
      trend levels. For bear trends, the reverse applies, staying short until a
      bullish reversal is convincingly confirmed.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Management:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Exiting positions if breakouts fail, especially in tight
      channels or trading ranges, which Brooks views as potential breakout
      scenarios on higher time frames. If the market doesn't sustain the
      breakout direction, it's a signal to exit.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategic Stop Placement:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Protective Stops:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks insists on <b>market stops</b> over mental stops,
      emphasizing, &quot;For any trade, you should always have protective stops
      in the market.&quot; Stops should be placed below major higher lows in
      bull trends or above major lower highs in bear trends, ensuring exits are
      based on market conditions, not emotional decisions.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Adjustment:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>As trends continue, he recommends trailing stops or
      adjusting them to just below new support/resistance levels formed during
      the trend progression to lock in profits without premature exits.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Taking and Scaling Out:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Targets:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Use the concept of <b>measured moves</b> for setting
      profit targets post-breakout. Brooks suggests taking profits when the
      market shows signs of trend exhaustion, particularly if these signs occur
      late in the trend.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Scaling Out:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>For those with larger positions, scaling out allows for
      capturing profits at different stages, especially useful in strong trends
      where initial profits can be locked in while allowing for further gains.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Reading Price Action for Exits:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bar Analysis:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Exiting when bars start closing away from the trend
      direction, or when they show signs of weakening momentum, like longer
      tails indicating increased selling pressure in bull trends or buying
      pressure in bear trends.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pullback Depth:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Deeper than usual pullbacks within a trend can signal a
      potential trend end or reversal. If pullbacks breach trend confirmation
      levels, it's time to reassess or exit.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Discipline in Exiting:</b><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding Emotional Traps:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks warns against exiting good trades too early out of
      fear or holding onto bad trades too long due to hope. He advises focusing
      on the probability of the trend's continuation rather than reacting to
      short-term market noise.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reflexive Reactions:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Exiting trades should be automatic responses to market
      signals, not emotional decisions. Brooks stresses the need for traders to
      train themselves to exit when the market clearly indicates a change in
      direction.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting in Channels and Market Regimes:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Dynamics:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Exits within channels might occur at strategic points
      like the middle third where resistance/support is likely, or when a
      breakout from the channel fails, indicating a return to range-bound
      behavior.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Regime Changes:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Adapting exit strategy when the market regime shifts,
      recognizing when a trend might be transitioning into a trading range or
      vice versa, requires traders to exit based on broader market context
      rather than isolated price movements.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' exit strategy is a blend of technical analysis,
market context understanding, and psychological discipline. He advocates for
exiting trades based on the market's behavior, using logical stop placement,
dynamic profit-taking strategies, and reacting to price action signals with
strategic foresight. His teachings emphasize not just the technical aspects of
when to exit but also the trader's mindset, encouraging decisions made on
market logic over emotional impulses. This holistic approach ensures traders
exit positions not out of fear or greed but when the market's narrative has
changed, aligning with his philosophy of trading in harmony with market trends
and dynamics.</p>

<b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Here are the key points
about exits from the summaries: </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting Positions in Al Brooks' Trading Strategy:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategic Stop Placement:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Place stops below major higher lows in bull trends or
      above major lower highs in bear trends.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Avoid placing stops at minor reversals to prevent
      premature exits from strong trends.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation and Reversal Signals:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>In bull trends, if the market breaks above a new high
      with strong bull bars, consider raising your stop to lock in profits. If
      it fails to stay above this level, reassess or exit.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>In bear trends, a strong breakout below a lower low
      suggests trend continuation. If price action reverses above a prior lower
      low, this might indicate weakness or transition to a trading range.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Dynamic Stop Management:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Use trailing stops in strong trends to capture profits
      while allowing the trade to run.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Adjust stops as the market moves, particularly after
      significant breakouts or when new support/resistance levels form.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Discipline:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Exit trades based on market signals, not emotional
      decisions. Avoid holding onto trades out of hope or exiting due to fear.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Train yourself to exit trades reflexively when market
      conditions change, not when influenced by emotions.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Context:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Exit when the market shows signs of trend exhaustion or
      reversal, like multiple failed attempts at new highs/lows or significant
      reversal bars.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>In trading ranges, be prepared for frequent exits based
      on smaller gains or losses due to market indecision.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Late-Day Dynamics:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Be cautious with late-day breakouts or reversals which
      might indicate trend exhaustion or be climactic moves.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Identification at Open:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>If a trend is identified from the market open and it
      shows signs of exhaustion or reversal, consider exiting, especially if
      the market has moved significantly since the open.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pre-Market Analysis:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Use the analysis of the previous day's chart and early
      morning market sentiment to prepare exit strategies before trading
      begins.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' exit strategies are deeply intertwined with
understanding market behavior, trend strength, and disciplined risk management,
ensuring that exits are based on market logic rather than emotional reactions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>As a heuristic tool, comment on the points that heavily
overlapped and the points that stood out alone through all 5 summaries of the
Exits.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here's an analysis based on the summaries concerning exit strategies:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Heavily Overlapped Points:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategic Stop Placement:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>All summaries emphasize the importance of placing stops
      below major higher lows in bull trends or above major lower highs in bear
      trends to validate the trend's continuation or exit when invalidated.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding Premature Exits:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>There is a recurring theme of not exiting trades
      prematurely due to minor pullbacks or reversals unless the trend shows
      significant signs of reversal or exhaustion.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Dynamic Stop Management:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>The use of trailing stops or adjusting stops as the
      market moves to protect profits while allowing for trend continuation was
      a common strategy.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Logic Over Emotional Decisions:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks consistently advises against exiting based on
      emotion (like fear or hope) but rather on market signals, trends, and
      logical stop placement.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>The concept that trends continue longer than expected,
      with advice to hold onto positions unless there's a clear market signal
      to exit, is prevalent.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Points That Stood Out Alone:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Identification at Open:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Unique to one summary, this point discusses exiting based
      on trends identified from the market open, particularly if these trends
      show signs of exhaustion or reversal early in the trading session.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Late-Day Dynamics:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Mentioned in one summary, cautioning about late-day
      breakouts or reversals which might indicate trend exhaustion or climactic
      moves. This wasn't emphasized as much in other summaries.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pre-Market Analysis:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Only in one summary, there's an emphasis on using
      pre-market analysis to prepare exit strategies, suggesting a proactive
      approach to setting up for the day's trades.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Handling Pullbacks and Reversals:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>While pullbacks and reversals were discussed broadly, one
      summary stood out in advocating for exiting or re-entering based on how
      these pullbacks develop in relation to trend validity, which adds a
      nuanced layer to the strategy.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exits in Channels:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Another summary specifically discussed exiting within the
      context of trading channels, focusing on how to manage exits when the
      market oscillates within a channel before breaking out.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, the core of Brooks' exit strategy revolves
around understanding trend validity, strategic stop placement, avoiding
emotional trading, and managing trades dynamically. Unique points often relate
to specific market conditions or times of day, providing additional layers of
strategy for traders to consider when deciding to exit positions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>fireflies.ai transcribed this meeting but I'm wondering
if you can ferret out a price action trading strategy for a day trader in the
style of al brooks' methodology from the following</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's a price action trading strategy for day trading,
inspired by Al Brooks' methodology, based on the transcription provided:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Al Brooks' Style Price Action Day Trading Strategy:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding Trends and Channels:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trends</b>: Recognize that trends are the foundation of
     price movement. A bull trend is characterized by higher highs and higher
     lows, while a bear trend features lower highs and lower lows. Trends can
     range from a single bar to the entire chart, but focus on major trends,
     which are typically one or two per chart.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channels</b>: All trends are confined within channels.
     Identify these by connecting swing highs and lows. Channels can be very
     steep or more gradual, but they help in visualizing where price action is
     likely to go next.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Key Trading Concepts:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry Points:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends</b>: Look to buy on pullbacks within a
      bull channel, particularly when the price pulls back to the middle third
      of the last rally. This is an area where bulls tend to step in, expecting
      the trend to continue.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends</b>: In bear trends, seek to sell on
      rallies, especially when price approaches the top of the channel or after
      a failed breakout above a lower high.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stops:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trend Stops</b>: Place your stop loss just below
      the most recent major higher low. This ensures you're out of the trade if
      the bull trend premise is invalidated.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trend Stops</b>: Position your stop just above
      the most recent major lower high to protect against a trend reversal.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation and Reversal Signals:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends</b>: If the market breaks above a new
      high, especially with strong bull bars, raise your stop to below the new
      higher low formed. If the market fails to stay above this low, consider
      that the bull trend might be over, potentially entering a trading range
      or bear trend.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends</b>: A breakout below a lower low with
      significant bear bars suggests the bear trend persists. If price action
      reverses above a prior lower low, reassess; the bear trend might weaken
      or transition to a trading range.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Handling Pullbacks and Reversals:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Expect pullbacks in trends to be opportunities for entry
      or re-entry. For instance, in a bull trend, if a reversal attempt fails
      and price holds above the recent higher low, it's often a signal to buy.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>In bear trends, after a rally fails to surpass a prior
      lower high, it's typically a good spot to sell or short, anticipating
      further decline.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Ranges vs. Trends:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>When trends show signs of weakening (e.g., price action
      not making new highs in bull trends or new lows in bear trends), prepare
      for potential trading ranges. Use these formations to adjust your
      strategy, potentially looking for breakouts or breakdowns from these
      ranges.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Aspect:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Understand that markets are always trying to reverse, but
      the persistence of higher lows or lower highs within established channels
      indicates the trend's validity. Patience in waiting for these
      confirmations can lead to more successful trades.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>This strategy involves a lot of visual analysis of chart
patterns, understanding the market's momentum through bar formations, and
managing risk with precise stop placements. Remember, the effectiveness of this
approach relies heavily on accurate trend and channel identification, which
requires practice and experience to master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>in the context of this video, in as many words as you
think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader EXITS a
position</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
In the context of this video, Al Brooks provides detailed recommendations on
how traders should exit positions, focusing on several key aspects:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Loss Placement:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Major Higher Lows/Lower Highs:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks underscores the importance of placing stops below
      major higher lows in bull trends or above major lower highs in bear
      trends. For instance, he mentions, &quot;Traders like to put their stops
      below the bottom of the most recent major higher low,&quot; emphasizing
      that stops should be logical according to the trend's structure rather
      than minor movements.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding Minor Reversals:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>He advises against placing stops below minor higher lows
      or above minor lower highs, as these are likely to lead to premature
      exits from a position, especially in strong trends. Brooks warns,
      &quot;Don't put your stock below minor higher lows because too often
      you'll get stopped out and the market will then resume up after going
      below your stop.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trailed Stops in Strong Trends:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation:</b> </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>In strong trends, Brooks recommends trailing stops to
      protect profits without exiting the trend prematurely. For example, he
      says, &quot;If the market reaches a new high or if there's a strong bull
      breakout, I'll raise my stop,&quot; indicating that stops should be
      adjusted dynamically as the trend progresses.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Dynamics:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>He discusses how in a bull trend, after a strong
      breakout, the trend can become broader and flatter. Here, stops can be
      moved to below the most recent significant low within the channel,
      allowing for potential price fluctuations without exiting the trend.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting Based on Trend Reversal Signals:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Validity:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks explains that if the market reverses above a major
      lower high in a bear trend or below a major higher low in a bull trend,
      it might indicate the end of the current trend. For example, &quot;If the
      market falls below a major higher low, the bull trend probably has
      ended,&quot; suggesting that once these conditions are met, it's time to
      exit.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Range or Bear/Bull Reversal:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>He notes that when a trend shows signs of weakening or
      reversing, like not maintaining above a prior lower high in a bear trend,
      the trader should reassess. If the market enters a trading range or shows
      a potential reversal, exiting might be necessary to avoid larger losses.
      Brooks states, &quot;If the market trades above a lower high as it did
      here, it's probably not going to be a bull trend, but it could be a
      weaker bear trend, closer to converting into a trading range.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Discipline:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Emotional Management:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks touches on the psychological aspect of holding
      onto a position too long or exiting too soon due to fear or greed. He
      emphasizes the need for discipline in sticking to the rules of trend
      following and stop placement, &quot;Bulls will buy bear closes&quot;
      because they expect reversals to fail, which also implies they exit only
      when their stop signals are triggered, not based on emotional decisions.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary of Exit Strategy:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Dynamic Stop Management</b>: Adjust stops based on
     trend progression, not minor pullbacks.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Major Trend Signals</b>: Use significant trend reversal
     signals (major higher lows or lower highs) as exit triggers.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding False Exits</b>: Be cautious of exiting on
     minor fluctuations within a strong trend.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Readiness</b>: Prepare to exit when the
     market logic dictates, not when influenced by emotion.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' philosophy is centered around understanding when a
trend has truly ended or when it's merely in a temporary phase of consolidation
or pullback. His exit strategy is inherently linked with his approach to
identifying trends, confirming them through price action, and using disciplined
stop-loss management to protect gains or minimize losses, always in line with
the market's broader movement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Now give me your executive summary of the video in 350
words”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
In this video, Al Brooks discusses key concepts of trend analysis in price
action trading, focusing on how to identify and trade within trends. He
emphasizes that trends are characterized by price movements in one direction,
with bull trends needing higher lows and bear trends requiring lower highs.
Trends are always contained within channels, which can be steep or gradual but
are crucial for understanding potential price movements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks explains that a trend can span from a single bar to
the entire chart, but he focuses on major trends, noting that at any given
time, there should be at most one or two major trends on the chart. Minor
movements are referred to as swings or legs rather than trends. He illustrates
and shows to identify these trends by drawing trend lines and channel lines,
using examples of bull and bear trends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For trading purposes, he advises that in bull trends,
traders should look to buy on pullbacks, ideally when the price reaches the
middle third of the last rally, and place stops just below major higher lows to
manage risk. Conversely, in bear trends, selling on rallies near the channel's
top or after a failed breakout above a lower high is recommended, with stops
set just above major lower highs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks also discusses how to handle trend reversals or
weakening trends, suggesting that if a market breaks below a major higher low
in a bull trend or above a major lower high in a bear trend, the current trend
might end, transitioning into a trading range or potentially reversing into the
opposite trend. He stresses the importance of not placing stops below minor
higher lows or above minor lower highs as these are less reliable for trend
confirmation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, the video teaches traders to recognize the
structure of trends, manage their trades based on trend strength, and adjust
strategies when trends appear to weaken or change direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>are you able to look through the transcript at the
references to the specific examples brooks makes, and talk about what he talks
about, how it relates to the context of the whole video--specific to his point
or broader...?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Certainly, let's delve into how Al Brooks uses specific examples in his
discussion on trends, and how these relate to the broader points he makes in
the video:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Examples and Their Context:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Chart Analysis for Trend Identification:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example of Bearish Breakout</b>: Brooks uses an
      example of a chart where there are repeated strong bearish moves followed
      by bullish attempts that fail. This example is used to illustrate that in
      a trading range, both bulls and bears have reasonable arguments, but
      since the market isn't clearly trending, it's still considered a trading
      range. This ties into his broader point that if a trend isn't clear, it's
      safer to assume the market is in a trading range.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Beginnings within Trading Ranges:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Early Bull and Bear Trends</b>: He discusses how
      within a trading range, there are smaller segments that could be seen as
      the beginning of a trend. For instance, he points out lower highs that
      could indicate the start of a bear trend or higher lows suggesting a
      potential bull trend. This example supports his point that trends can
      emerge from trading ranges, but recognizing these early stages requires
      patience and confirmation.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Trends and Pullbacks:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trend with Pullbacks</b>: Brooks uses an example
      where the bull trend has small pullbacks, emphasizing that these
      pullbacks are often buying opportunities rather than signs of a trend
      reversal. This supports his strategy of buying in strong bull trends on
      minor pullbacks, reinforcing the idea that trends often continue longer
      than expected.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Channel with Failed Reversals:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tight Bear Channel</b>: He discusses a scenario where
      the bear channel is tight, and any bullish attempts are minor, leading to
      either a bear flag or a trading range. This example illustrates the 80%
      rule where most (80% of) reversal attempts fail, advising traders to look
      for selling opportunities in such conditions rather than buying.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Bar Example:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strong Bull Breakout</b>: Brooks describes a scenario
      where a market has a small trading range and then suddenly experiences a
      significant bullish bar that breaks out. He uses this to explain how
      trend beginnings can be very volatile, requiring traders to adjust their
      stop placement and risk management. This ties into his broader strategy
      of not just focusing on risk but also on the probability of the trend's
      continuation.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Relation to Broader Points:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding Market Phases</b>: Each example serves to
     illustrate different market phases (breakout, channel, trading range),
     helping traders understand when to expect certain behaviors from the
     market. This is crucial for Brooks' teaching that markets are always in
     one of these phases, and recognizing which phase helps in making informed
     trading decisions.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability and Risk</b>: The examples of failed
     reversals and the 80% rule highlight the importance of probability over
     just risk management. Brooks emphasizes that while risk is inherent,
     understanding the market's tendencies (like the 80% failure rate of
     reversals) can guide better entry and exit points.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation</b>: Through examples where trends
     continue despite seeming overextended, Brooks challenges the common
     trader's mindset that trends must reverse soon. His examples show that
     markets can move much further than anticipated, urging traders to ride
     trends with appropriate stops rather than prematurely exiting.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Discipline</b>: The discussion on pullbacks and
     breakout management underscores the need for discipline in trading. Brooks
     uses examples to show that while markets offer many opportunities, not all
     should be taken. The strategic use of stops and waiting for confirmation
     are key elements of his disciplined approach.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, Brooks uses specific chart examples to drive
home his points about market behavior, the importance of trend recognition, and
the strategic patience required in trading. These examples are not just for
understanding how to trade specific setups but are woven into his broader
narrative about market dynamics, trader psychology, and the inherent
probabilities in trading trends.</p>

Speaks Specifically:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>what quotation pointers can you find from brooks about
the trading calculation and behaviour from traders? Examples such as &quot;when
the market come to the middle 1/3 of the channel bulls buy again&quot; type
thing</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here are some key quotations from Al Brooks about trading calculations and
behavior from the transcript provided:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends and Buying Opportunities</b>: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;If the market pulls back somewhere into the middle
      third of the last leg up, bulls buy.&quot; This highlights a specific
      strategy within a bull trend where buying is initiated not at the bottom
      of a pullback but at a strategic point within the trend's channel.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Placement in Bull Trends</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bulls like to buy reversals up at the bottom of
      channels.&quot; This refers to how traders might look for buying
      opportunities when the market approaches or hits the bottom trend line in
      a bull channel.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Trends tend to weaken as time goes on... Bulls sell
      at new highs as well to take profits.&quot; This points to the behavior
      of traders within a trend, expecting pullbacks to fail and capitalizing
      on these expectations.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychology of Trading in a Trend</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bulls will buy bear closes and they'll use the
      appropriate stops.&quot; This reflects the mindset of trend traders who
      are confident in the continuation of the trend, buying into what appears
      to be bearish activity within the trend.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Handling Minor Reversals in Strong Trends</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;If you're a bull trend trader and you see this, we
      have a double top you can call a wedge... Probably the bull trend is over
      and probably the market is either in a trading range or a bear
      trend.&quot; Here, Brooks discusses how traders interpret trend signals,
      especially at potential reversals.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategic Selling in Bear Trends</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bears are starting to sell new highs,&quot;
      indicating a trading behavior where bears look for opportunities to short
      when the market reaches high points within a bear trend.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Management during Trend Reversals</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;If the market trades above a lower high as it did
      here, it's probably not going to be a bull trend... usually the best the
      bulls can get is a trading range.&quot; This illustrates how traders
      adjust their stops based on market movements, particularly during
      potential trend reversals.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Behavior During Failed Breakouts</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;75% of bear channel breakouts where the market
      breaks below the bottom of the bear channel will reverse up to the top of
      the channel or to the top of the most recent sell climax.&quot; This
      quote by Brooks shows a statistical behavior pattern traders can expect,
      influencing their trading decisions.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>These quotes encapsulate Brooks' insights into how traders
should behave within trends, focusing on strategic entry points, stop
placement, and understanding market psychology and statistical tendencies.</p>

Certainly! Here's a structured comparison between tactics and strategy as
discussed by Al Brooks in the context of the video, using his examples,
statements, and quips:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics vs. Strategy in Al Brooks' Trading Philosophy:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Recognition:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Identifying specific patterns like higher
      lows in bull trends or lower highs in bear trends. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quip</b>: &quot;Bull trends need higher lows, they're
      even more important than higher highs, because the higher lows determine
      where traders put their stops.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Price Action:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Reacting to individual bars or small sets
      of bars for entry and exit points within a trend or trading range.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;Bulls will buy bear closes and
      they'll use the appropriate stop.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Placement:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Placing stops just below significant
      higher lows or above significant lower highs to manage risk during
      trades.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Statement</b>: &quot;Traders like to put their stops
      below the bottom of the most recent major higher low.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Trading:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Entering trades on breakouts of trend
      channels or ranges.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;A breakout is the strongest type of
      trend. It can be one bar, it can be many bars.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pullback Buying/Selling:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Buying in bull trends on pullbacks within
      the middle third of the last rally or selling in bear trends on rallies
      near the top of the channel.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Insight</b>: &quot;Bulls like to see these
      reversal attempts... They buy it because they expect the reversal attempt
      will fail.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Phase Identification:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Understanding whether the market is in a
      trend or a trading range, which dictates the overall approach to trading.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quip</b>: &quot;If it's not clearly in a trend, you
      have to assume it's in a trading range.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Following:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Trading with the trend, not against it,
      which means buying in bull trends and selling in bear trends, even when
      it feels counterintuitive due to market noise or minor reversals.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Philosophy</b>: &quot;Whenever a trend is very strong,
      you don't want to be the only person selling.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Implementing stops based on major trend
      characteristics rather than minor market movements, understanding the
      difference between major and minor trend reversals.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight</b>: &quot;A major higher low is one that has
      a very strong bull breakout and usually results in a new high.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability Over Prediction:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Not just focusing on risk but on the
      probability of market movements, understanding that 80% of breakout
      attempts in a trading range will fail.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Rule</b>: &quot;80% of breakout attempts fail
      within a trading range.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Discipline:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Cultivating the mindset to stay in
      trades that align with the trend despite minor adverse movements,
      avoiding the common mistake of trading against the trend due to fear or
      impatience.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;Beginners often focus too much on
      risk... They're always looking for the tightest possible stop.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Contrast:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics</b> are about the 'how' of trading - the
     specific actions you take in response to market movements, like placing
     entry orders, managing stops, and reacting to short-term patterns within
     the trend or range. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>, on the other hand, is about the 'why' -
     the overarching philosophy that guides trade selection, risk management,
     market analysis, and trader psychology. Brooks' strategy revolves around
     understanding market phases, the strength of trends, and the probability
     of market movements, which then informs the tactics used in trading.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' philosophy emphasizes that while tactics are crucial
for executing trades, the true mastery in trading comes from understanding and
aligning with the strategic elements of market behavior, trend persistence, and
trader discipline. His teachings suggest that successful trading is not just
about knowing what to do at the moment but understanding why and when to do it,
aligning with the broader market trends and phases.</p>

Remember, you have the same transcript though fireflies took the transcript. I
want you to summarize where you overlapped and where you differed, pointing towards
what’s salient in the video to focus upon. Decide upon what’s important through
the lens of what Brooks quips or states specifically. Can you add to this
strategically placed quotations by brooks in the transcript”</a></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here's how my summary of Al Brooks' video on trends compares with what
Fireflies.ai might produce, focusing on the key points Brooks emphasizes based
on the provided transcript:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Overlap in Summaries:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend vs. Trading Range:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Both</b>: Would stress the importance of distinguishing
      between trends and trading ranges. Brooks says, &quot;If it's not clearly
      in a trend, you have to assume it's in a trading range,&quot; emphasizing
      the need for clarity in market direction.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Trends:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Both</b>: Would discuss how trends are contained
      within channels, with Brooks stating, &quot;All trends are contained
      within channels.&quot; This is essential for understanding where to place
      stops and identify entry points.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Placement:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Both</b>: Would highlight the strategic placement of
      stops below major higher lows or above major lower highs. Brooks advises,
      &quot;Traders like to put their stops below the bottom of the most recent
      major higher low,&quot; which is critical for risk management.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Differences and Focus:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategic Quotes and Emphasis:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary</b>: Focuses on Brooks' strategic advice on
      trend trading, like &quot;Most bulls would conclude that if we go to a
      new high and drop below this low, we're no longer in a bull trend,&quot;
      illustrating the importance of trend continuation in trading decisions.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai</b>: Might list these quotes but might
      not emphasize how they relate to a broader trading strategy or trader
      psychology.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Behavior and Psychology:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary</b>: Delves into Brooks' view on market
      behavior, using quotes like &quot;Trends are always trying to
      reverse&quot; but also highlights the likelihood of these reversals
      failing, which is crucial for understanding market inertia.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai</b>: Could provide a factual
      transcription but might not weave in the psychological aspect or the
      strategic patience required in trading, as Brooks does.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Confirmation and Reversals:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary</b>: Uses Brooks' example of how to confirm
      a trend and when to expect a reversal or continuation, &quot;If the
      market falls below a major higher low, the bull trend probably has
      ended,&quot; to educate traders on trend dynamics.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai</b>: Might mention these points but could
      miss the educational intent behind Brooks' examples on how to practically
      apply these concepts.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Strategy Application:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary</b>: Integrates Brooks' teaching on how to
      trade within trends, emphasizing &quot;Bulls will buy bear closes,&quot;
      which encapsulates his philosophy on trend following and managing
      positions within trends.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai</b>: Would likely cover this in terms of
      factual data points from the transcript without focusing on how these
      practices fit into a comprehensive trading strategy or mindset.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Salient Points to Focus On:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Recognition</b>: The necessity to recognize when
     a market is in a trend or a trading range. Brooks' repeated emphasis on
     this helps traders avoid common pitfalls in trend analysis.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Loss Discipline</b>: Brooks' constant reference to
     stop placement, like &quot;Don't put your stock below minor higher lows
     because too often you'll get stopped out,&quot; is a key takeaway for risk
     management.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation vs. Reversal</b>: His insights on
     how trends continue longer than expected and the psychological challenge
     this poses to traders, &quot;Trends tend to weaken as time goes on,&quot;
     is vital for trader development.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Dynamics</b>: Understanding that markets are
     always &quot;trying to reverse&quot; but often fail to do so, which Brooks
     uses as a foundation for his trading strategies, pointing towards the
     importance of patience and confirmation in trading.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By focusing on these points, traders can better grasp
Brooks' methodology, which isn't just about technical patterns but about
understanding market behavior, managing risk, and developing the discipline to
trade trends effectively.</p>

Talk: Stochastic Oscillator in video’s Context</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>describe to me how the stochastic oscillator works and
how to use it or interpret it using the al brooks stuff above</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding the Stochastic Oscillator:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What it is:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that
     compares the closing price of a security to its price range over a specific
     period, typically 14 days. It oscillates between 0 and 100, aiming to
     signal overbought or oversold conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Key Components:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>%K (Fast Stochastic)</b>: This line calculates how the
     current close relates to the recent trading range. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>%D (Slow Stochastic)</b>: A moving average of %K,
     usually a 3-period simple moving average, which smooths out the data to
     reduce false signals.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Interpretation:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Overbought</b>: Above 80, suggesting that the price
     might be due for a downward correction.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Oversold</b>: Below 20, indicating the price might be
     due for an upward correction.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Crossovers</b>: When %K crosses above %D, it's a signal
     for potential upward momentum; when it crosses below, it suggests
     potential downward momentum.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>Using
Stochastic Oscillator in Trending Scenarios According to Al Brooks'
Methodology:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Higher Lows and Stochastic</b>: In a bull trend, where
     Al Brooks emphasizes the importance of higher lows, the stochastic
     oscillator can help confirm momentum. </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Look for oversold signals (below 20)</b>: These might
      coincide with price pullbacks, which are common in bull trends. If the
      stochastic moves from oversold back above 20 while the price makes a
      higher low, it could signal the end of the pullback and a continuation of
      the trend.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Divergence</b>: If the price makes a higher low, but
      the stochastic makes a lower low, this bearish divergence could warn of a
      possible trend reversal. However, Brooks would likely advise caution
      here, suggesting that only a break below a major higher low would truly indicate
      a trend change.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Placement</b>: Use the stochastic to help with
     stop placement. If you buy on a stochastic bounce from oversold levels,
     place your stop below the last major higher low, as Brooks suggests, to
     manage risk.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Lower Highs and Stochastic</b>: In bear trends, where
     lower highs are critical:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Watch for overbought signals (above 80)</b>: These
      might occur during short rallies within a bear trend. A move from
      overbought back below 80 could signal a resumption of the downtrend.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Divergence</b>: A bullish divergence where the price
      makes a lower high but the stochastic makes a higher high might suggest
      the bear trend is weakening. However, Brooks' methodology would still
      require a breach above a major lower high to confirm a trend shift.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Selling Opportunities</b>: Use overbought signals to
     look for short entries, especially if they coincide with price action near
     the top of a bear channel.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Interpreting Reversals:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Breakouts</b>: When using the stochastic in
     conjunction with channel analysis:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>If the price breaks above a channel line in a bear trend
      with the stochastic moving from oversold to above 20, it might hint at a
      reversal, but only if other criteria like breaking above a significant
      lower high are met.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>In bull trends, a drop below the channel line with the
      stochastic dipping into oversold territory might suggest a reversal if
      the price falls below a major higher low.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>False Signals</b>: Both Brooks and the stochastic
     oscillator warn against false signals:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>In strong trends, the stochastic might remain in
      overbought or oversold conditions longer than expected. Brooks advocates
      for understanding the market context; hence, one shouldn't trade based
      solely on the oscillator but should look for confirmation through price
      action, like channel integrity or trend line breaks.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Combining with Other Indicators</b>: Brooks often
     discusses combining various forms of analysis for confirmation. The
     stochastic can be used alongside trend lines, support/resistance, and
     Brooks' focus on higher lows or lower highs to filter out noise and
     confirm potential reversals or continuations.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By integrating the stochastic oscillator with Al Brooks'
price action methodology, traders can enhance their analysis of market
momentum, trend strength, and potential reversal points, always considering the
broader market context and trend structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, bear trends need lower highs in a
trend.&nbsp;Prices move mostly in one direction.&nbsp;So here, lower left,
upper right, even though the market went sideways for a couple of
times.&nbsp;Also, trends are contained within channels.&nbsp;All trends are
contained within channels.&nbsp;Some channels are very steep, but the channels
are there.&nbsp;There's a trend line below and the trend channel line
above.&nbsp;The trend channel line can be simply a parallel of this line, or
you can draw the line connecting tops.&nbsp;Now I said every trend is contained
in a channel.&nbsp;The channel might not be all that obvious, but it's there
and it's important to learn how to recognize it.&nbsp;This is a bull trend
bar.&nbsp;Bull trend bar.&nbsp;A trend can be as small as a single bar and it
could be as large as the entire chart.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 01:07 Here we had
a trend lasting two bars going up and then many bars going down.&nbsp;When I
use the word trend, I'm talking about a major trend, even though I don't always
say major.&nbsp;And there are at most one or two of them on the chart at any
one time.&nbsp;If you see three or four trends on the chart, those trends are
minor, and I usually don't use the term trend to describe them.&nbsp;I usually
refer to them as swings or legs.&nbsp;Here we have a bull trend.&nbsp;Is this a
bear trend?&nbsp;I would call it more of a bear swing.&nbsp;It's about a 50%
pullback of this bull trend.&nbsp;Plus it's much less strong than the bull
trend.&nbsp;And this is a bull trend.&nbsp;Again, I would call it a
swing.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 01:54 It's less than half of the bars on the chart
and it's not particularly strong.&nbsp;So to me, this is a bull trend followed
by a bear swing and a bull swing.&nbsp;I said that a bull trend and higher
lows, and it's contained within a rising channel.&nbsp;The bottom line is the
trend line, the bull trend line, and the top line is the trend channel line,
trend line, channel line.&nbsp;Some people refer to both as trend
lines.&nbsp;So some people say this is the bottom trend line.&nbsp;That's the
top trend line of the channel.&nbsp;I usually refer to the upper line as the
trend channel line.&nbsp;In general, traders like to put their stops below the
bottom of the most recent major higher low.&nbsp;Here we have a major
low.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 02:56 We don't know if it's a higher low, but it's
certainly the start of this bull trend.&nbsp;And traders like to put their
stops just below there if they're buying.&nbsp;Is this a major higher low right
here?&nbsp;No, I talked about this in earlier videos.&nbsp;A major higher low
is one that has a Very strong bowl breakout and usually results in a new
high.&nbsp;And this did not get to a new high.&nbsp;And it's not a very strong
bull breakup.&nbsp;So it's a minor higher low right here.&nbsp;And that is not
a good location for a stop.&nbsp;You still keep the stop down
here.&nbsp;Whether you're swinging or scalping, your stop is down here.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 03:41 Again, don't put your stock below minor higher lows because
too often you'll get stopped out and the market will then resume up after going
below your stock stop below here, here, all are bad stops.&nbsp;The correct
stop is down here.&nbsp;Again, it doesn't matter if you're swing trading or
scalping.&nbsp;This is where your stock goes below the bottom of the last
strong leg up.&nbsp;So if you put your stop below this bar or below that bar or
below this bar, you would have been stopped out, yet the trend would have
continued.&nbsp;This is not enough to change the premise that the market is in
a bull trend.&nbsp;It's a pullback.&nbsp;You can call it a trading range, but
it's still in a bull trend.&nbsp;I'll raise my stop if the market reaches a new
high or if there's a strong bull breakout.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 04:45 One bar
usually is not enough.&nbsp;But here we got a couple decent bull bars and a new
high, and this low followed.&nbsp;These lows went to a lower low.&nbsp;Most
fools would conclude that if we go to a new high and drop below this low, we're
no longer in a bull trend.&nbsp;We're not necessarily in a bear trend, but the
bull trend has ended.&nbsp;Traders would then view the chart as being either in
our trading range or possibly in a bear trend.&nbsp;This is a good location for
a stop after you have this full breakout.&nbsp;A lot of traders might still
keep their stop down here, but most would not.&nbsp;After you get a new high
with a couple decent bull bars and you're getting a failed breakout below the
trading range.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 05:29 That combination of factors is
enough to make this a major higher low.&nbsp;And the bulls should not allow the
market to fall below it if the premise of a bull trend is still valid.&nbsp;I
said that if the market falls below a prior higher low, it may be converting
into the trading range or bear trend.&nbsp;But if it falls below a minor higher
low like this, all it's doing is converting into a flatter full channel, a
broader, flatter bull channel.&nbsp;We have a very tight bull channel here, but
at this point we start going up.&nbsp;The channel now is broader and flatter.&nbsp;This
is what I mean.&nbsp;I mentioned that bull trends need higher
lows.&nbsp;They're Even more important than higher highs, because the higher
lows determine where traders put their stops.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 06:37 So if
the market falls below a prior higher low here, below here, it can still be a
bull trend, but it might be a broader, flatter, weaker bull trend, closer to
converting into a trading range.&nbsp;And it's possible that it could even be
converting into a bear trend.&nbsp;Typically though, when you have a trend that
strongly up, it's not going to go directly into a bear trend that usually first
has to convert into a trading range.&nbsp;So we got a strong bull breakout to a
new high.&nbsp;So this then becomes a major higher low once you see
this.&nbsp;Bulls raise their stock from here to there.&nbsp;So they trail their
stock, they tighten their stock.&nbsp;This is not going to convert into a trend
in the opposite direction by falling straight down.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 07:33
Probably the best the beers get is a trading range and they usually typically need
at least a small double top.&nbsp;If you're a bull trend trader and you see
this, we have a double top you can call a wedge.&nbsp;One, two, no bull bar,
some more beer bars.&nbsp;So now you have six bars down, five beer bars and you
fell below a major higher low.&nbsp;Probably the bull trend is over and
probably the market is either in a trading range or a bear Trend.&nbsp;It's
about a 50 pullback from this rally.&nbsp;So the bulls will stop themselves out
as the market falls below that low.&nbsp;However, it's still probably at least
a trading range.&nbsp;The bears probably will need a major trend reversal if
they're going to convert it into a bear trend.&nbsp;And that's what they
got.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 08:24 They got a wedge lower high, three pushes up,
1, 2, 3 wedge lower high, decent sell signal bar.&nbsp;And they converted it
into a bear trend.&nbsp;It still could be a large high to buy like one
pullback, two, it's holding above this low.&nbsp;But I think most bulls get out
below that low or above this bull bar and bears would short somewhere in here
or they were short this wedge lower high for swing down bull trend.&nbsp;In
this case, it's a fairly broad bull channel.&nbsp;We have higher highs all the
way up.&nbsp;We have higher lows all the way up.&nbsp;And after each strong
breakout to new high, bulls will raise their stop to below the most recent
higher low.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 09:14 And you can see after each strong
breakout to a new high, when there's a pullback, it did not fall below the most
recent higher low.&nbsp;This did not fall below that.&nbsp;And then a strong
breakout to a new high, major higher low.&nbsp;Market tried to reverse down,
terrible follow through.&nbsp;It became a bear trap and the bull trend resumed
so each reversal attempt held above the most recent prior higher
low.&nbsp;That's one of the hallmarks of a bull trend.&nbsp;In a broad bull
channel like this, you often have pretty strong sell offs.&nbsp;We have many of
them here.&nbsp;And sometimes the sellers are even strong enough to convert the
market into always in short, in other words, an early bear trend.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 09:59 However, unless the bears are able to get below major
higher lows, even if it becomes briefly always in short, the odds are the bull
trend will continue.&nbsp;I would say that this market was not short.&nbsp;I
think even though we had pullbacks here, 10 bars, 15 bars, I think it stayed
always in long because the bears failed to get consecutive big bear trend
bars.&nbsp;They have two bear bars here, but a tail and followed by a bull
bar.&nbsp;So to me, this is not enough to convert the market to always in
short, sometimes when you have a broad bull channel, the market will sometimes
become always in short.&nbsp;Yet the market can still be in the broad bull
channel.&nbsp;I'm always drawing lines on charts.&nbsp;You start with what you
have in front of you, add it to the right.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 10:50 You have
to adjust your lines.&nbsp;The lines are rarely ever perfect.&nbsp;At this
point, I'm using these lines, but then the market falls below here.&nbsp;Then I
use this point for my line.&nbsp;But it's still a bull trend.&nbsp;It's just
flatter.&nbsp;It's not as vertical.&nbsp;And it's also broader at that
point.&nbsp;So you can see here, we fell below the blue line, so now we have a
new low.&nbsp;Market rallies.&nbsp;This is now my trend and we fell below that
line.&nbsp;So when it starts up, I'll replace this line with one down
here.&nbsp;And when you get to the bottom of channels, bulls like to buy
reversals up.&nbsp;So they buy about this bar and they buy above that bar or
this bar.&nbsp;I said that we had reversal attempts repeatedly in this broad
bull channel.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 11:44 None of them was strong enough to
convert the trend to always in short.&nbsp;And the bulls expect all of these
reversal attempts to fail.&nbsp;So when they see a bear reversal attempt, what
are they doing?&nbsp;They're buying.&nbsp;Anytime there's a broad bull channel
and it pulls back somewhere into the middle of the last leg up pulls
by.&nbsp;Okay, we have a rally pull back somewhere in the middle third, bulls
buy.&nbsp;A rally pulls back to the middle third of the that last rally buy
rally pull back somewhere into the middle of that rally, we'll start looking to
buy.&nbsp;And then they tend to take partial profits at new highs.&nbsp;And
that's what in part creates the pullbacks and bears See something really
important.&nbsp;So let's say you're a bear and you see this right
here.&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 12:29 A new high and a pullback that
fell below this high.&nbsp;Well, what are you going to do if you're a
bear?&nbsp;Well, you'll see this high.&nbsp;You're going to place a limit order
to sell at that high, betting that will drop back down below the sign because
that's what we did before.&nbsp;And trends tend to weaken as time goes
on.&nbsp;So bulls are buying pullbacks to the middle third of the last leg
up.&nbsp;So they buy somewhere in here.&nbsp;And bears are starting to sell new
highs.&nbsp;And bulls sell at new highs as well to take profits.&nbsp;And bulls
like to see these reversal attempts.&nbsp;As long as the market's continuing to
make higher lows, they assume the trend will continue.&nbsp;So whenever they
see a reversal attempt like this or that or this, guess what?&nbsp;Guess.&nbsp;
S Stephen Crane 13:14 They buy it because they expect the reversal attempt will
fail.&nbsp;So the bulls will buy bear closes and they'll use the appropriate
stock.&nbsp;A bull buying this close, the stop is below the most recent major
higher low.&nbsp;And he bet that the bear reversal would fail and that the trend
up would continue.&nbsp;Same with him.&nbsp;You could buy that close.&nbsp;You
could buy below that bull bar because it's a bad looking sell.&nbsp;You can buy
that bear close.&nbsp;Another attempt to reverse, you buy back close.&nbsp;I
wouldn't draw this as a trend line here and extend it across.&nbsp;However,
either one of these you can use for the first point of a line.&nbsp;And then
here's an obvious second point.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 13:58 We reverse down and
to find the bottom of the channel, you could either simply use lows like draw a
line from here to here, or you can use a parallel line.&nbsp;At this point, we
know the market was turning down here.&nbsp;Maybe it'll fall to the bottom of
the channel that is created from a parallel level.&nbsp;Once we start to turn
down here, a lot of traders can see an obvious top of a channel and they'll
create a parallel of it and drag it down to a bar that contains all of the
bars.&nbsp;Would I drag it to this bar?&nbsp;No, because these bars would then
below the channel.&nbsp;I want to drag it down to the bar.&nbsp;That would
result in the channel containing all of the bars.&nbsp;And then traders will
look to buy a reversal up.&nbsp;Channels are rarely perfect.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 14:49 There's usually some problem with every channel.&nbsp;But it gives
you an idea of what the market's trying to do.&nbsp;And if the market's near
the bottom of the channel, traders look to buy for a reverse loss.&nbsp;And if
it gets near the top of a channel, they look to sell for a pullback.&nbsp;Just
like a bull trend needs higher lows, a bear trend needs lower highs.&nbsp;Bear
trend has lower highs and lower lows and is contained in a falling channel
right here.&nbsp;So here we have a spike down a pullback and then a bear
channel.&nbsp;Now this is a major lower high.&nbsp;We have a reasonably strong
breakout to a new low.&nbsp;A lot of bears will put their stops above that high
and I cannot tell if this went above that.&nbsp;It looks like it might
have.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 15:42 And if a bear did exit on a stop above that
bar, he would look to sell again on a reversal down because of a possible
double top bear flag.&nbsp;So double top bear flag neckline, looking for a
measured move down.&nbsp;The top of the channel is the bear trend line and the
bottom is the channel line.&nbsp;So be trend channel line.&nbsp;In a bear
trend, bears want to put their stops above the top of some major sell
off.&nbsp;Here we have a very strong bear breakout.&nbsp;So bear selling
anywhere this close at the market above this bar, below that bar, doesn't
matter.&nbsp;Their stop is still above this high.&nbsp;So it's above the most
recent major high.&nbsp;Let's say we're at this point.&nbsp;Is this a major
high?&nbsp;Will bears lower their stops from here to here?&nbsp;I don't think
so.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 16:43 That's not particularly strong bear breakout
and did not get down to a new low.&nbsp;The bears who shorted for any reason
still have their stop up here because they know since this is not a major low,
the market could easily go above it and still be in a bear trend.&nbsp;So you
get a low two or a wedge bear flag.&nbsp;So we get one more slightly higher
high, another slightly higher high and still be in a rare trend.&nbsp;If you're
selling for any reason, your stop is above the top of this major sell
off.&nbsp;This is a bad location for a stop.&nbsp;Like I said, you could easily
get two legged pullback, one pullback and then two going above that minor lower
high and then the bear trend could resume down from below.&nbsp;Two bear
flag.&nbsp;And that's what happened.&nbsp;One pull back too.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 17:39 We have a two legged bear fly below, two short double top bear
flag, decent sell signal mark a bear who sold down here, anywhere in here and
then put a stop just above that lower high.&nbsp;Lost money in a bear
trend.&nbsp;And if the bear made that mistake, he should get short again as the
bear trend resumes down.&nbsp;So he would sell again below that bear
bar.&nbsp;Now here we have a low two bear flag, failed breakout, a failed
reversal attempt and then we broke out fairly strongly to a new low.&nbsp;At
this close, a lot of the bears will tighten their stops.&nbsp;They'll say, oh,
this is pretty major.&nbsp;We got a new low and we have a pretty decent bear
bar.&nbsp;And that's after trying to reverse up.&nbsp;So the market should not
get above this bar.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 18:32 If it gets above this bar, then
the premise of the bear trend is probably no longer valid.&nbsp;The market
would then either be in a trading range or in a bull trend.&nbsp;And if you're
trading it like a bear trend and it has become a trading range or a bull trend,
you want to get up because your premise of a bear trend is no longer
valid.&nbsp;So after a strong breakout, this becomes a major lower
high.&nbsp;And bears will take their stock from here and put it to just above
there.&nbsp;Pretty tight channel.&nbsp;And if the market trades above a lower
high as it did here, it's probably not going to be a bull trend, but it could
be a weaker bear trend.&nbsp;It could be a trading range, but more likely it's
going to be a weaker bear trend.&nbsp;Broader bladder.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane
19:26 So initially we had this as the bear trend, very tight.&nbsp;And then
once we have this lower high, we can draw a line here, still pretty
tight.&nbsp;And now we have a new high above both of those possible bear
channels.&nbsp;So now we have a new channel from this high to that high, and
it's broader and flatter than the other channels.&nbsp;Here we got a bear micro
channel.&nbsp;So it's a breakout on a higher time frame chart.&nbsp;And we have
a series of lower highs and lower lows.&nbsp;Is this a major lower
high?&nbsp;Probably is.&nbsp;Had a pretty strong bear breakout and follow
through and it made a new low.&nbsp;And then also we're trying to get a bear
breakout below a bear channel.&nbsp;So if you connect these lows, that would
create a bear channel.&nbsp;And here we're trying to break below it.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 20:16 That's not a good thing.&nbsp;75 of beer channel breakouts
where the market breaks below the bottom of the bear channel.&nbsp;75 of them
will reverse up to the top of the channel or to the top of the most recent cell
climax.&nbsp;This bar may be that bar.&nbsp;But in any case, if you're short
and you are going to exit on a stop, your stop now is above this bar or above
that bar.&nbsp;Both of those are reasonable.&nbsp;And what happens if you get
stopped off?&nbsp;Is it a bull trend?&nbsp;No, a tight bear channel like this
usually cannot then become a bull trend.&nbsp;Usually the best the bulls can
get is a trading range.&nbsp;And if the bears are unable to resume the trend
down, the bulls have a shot at a major trend reversal within that trading range.&nbsp;
S Stephen Crane 21:04 And at that point, the probability of the bulls taking
control is better.&nbsp;Usually the first breakout of a channel results in a
minor reversal in a trading range or a bear flag rather than a bull
trend.&nbsp;The bears get stopped out here and a strong gold bar and a pretty
good reversal.&nbsp;Strongly down, strongly up.&nbsp;Probably a minor
reversal.&nbsp;Some bears will sell below this bar on the failed breakout above
these bars.&nbsp;Others will wait to see if we get a series of bear bars, three
or four bear bars and then sell.&nbsp;Or if we get a micro double top strong
enough bull bar, probably at least a minor second leg up likely.&nbsp;And in
this particular case, we got a particularly strong leg up.&nbsp;It went above
all of the highs in the channel.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 21:53 Did not get above
the top of the bull trend.&nbsp;So what do you do?&nbsp;Not a lot of traders
would sell below that bar.&nbsp;Two legs up, one, two or a wedge.&nbsp;One or
one and then two, three or one, two, three different ways to draw
it.&nbsp;We'll look at this as a possible second leg trap in a developing
trading range.&nbsp;First leg up, pull back, second leg up.&nbsp;Terrible
follow through and pretty bad follow through.&nbsp;And we did not get above
this high.&nbsp;So this is probably a bullet in a trading range.&nbsp;A lot of
bears will sell that and the bulls probably would get out because disappointing
follow through.&nbsp;Despite a strong gold breakout.&nbsp;All trends are
constantly trying to reverse.&nbsp;So here we have a bear trend.&nbsp;Lower
highs, lower lows.&nbsp;Constantly trying to reverse.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane
22:44 And sometimes the reversal up is strong enough to make the market always
in long.&nbsp;Here we have a bull breakout above this lower high and a follow
through bar, tail on top.&nbsp;Not especially big, but probably always in
lawn.&nbsp;Pretty common when you're in a broad bear channel for the market to
become always in long.&nbsp;However, usually the bear trend resumes before the
market gets above major lower high.&nbsp;Like this or like that.&nbsp;Even
though the market rallied up strongly, especially here, in many attempts to
reverse up, every rally resulted in a lower high.&nbsp;So it's still a bear
channel.&nbsp;And traders will look to sell the reversal down.&nbsp;Now you
have a beer bar and a follow through bar.&nbsp;Bear bar.&nbsp;Do you put the
stop above this high or above that high?&nbsp;No, this is a minor lower
high.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 23:37 Did not have a strong bear breakout.&nbsp;Did
not get to a new low.&nbsp;And therefore putting a stop just above the high of
that bar is a low probability bet.&nbsp;You're throwing money away.&nbsp;You
still have to rely on your swing saw.&nbsp;Now what about this?&nbsp;Is this a
good enough major lower high?&nbsp;So bears can put their stops above
it.&nbsp;Maybe this is not a strong beer breakout, but it is a new low.&nbsp;A
lot of bears will not put their stuff up here.&nbsp;They'll keep the stop up
here.&nbsp;If the bears do put their stop just above this bar and they get
stopped out here, they'll look to sell a reversal down either below either of
these bars or below here, betting that the rally does not look strong.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 24:18 It looks more like either a bull leg in a trading range or
a bull leg that becomes a bear flag.&nbsp;Bears, they see these strong rallies
and they say, yeah, it's a strong rally, maybe it's even always in
one.&nbsp;But it did not get above the top of this majority lower high and
therefore it's probably going to fail.&nbsp;Become a bear flag.&nbsp;So bears
will look to sell.&nbsp;The same with here.&nbsp;You say, oh, we rallied for 15
bars.&nbsp;That's pretty bullish.&nbsp;It is, but it lacked consecutive big
bull trend.&nbsp;Bars closing in their highs.&nbsp;And it did not get above the
most recent major lower high.&nbsp;So bears will be selling here
again.&nbsp;Channels are really perfect.&nbsp;Can see the way I drew it.&nbsp;I
connected this high and that high and ignored this bar going slightly
above.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 25:09 And we're trying to go slightly above
again.&nbsp;Traders don't really care if it hits the
channel.&nbsp;Exactly.&nbsp;And turns down.&nbsp;They care that it turns down
somewhere around the channel.&nbsp;So bears are looking to sell on a reversal
down from the channel.&nbsp;The top of the channel, somewhere around the
channel.&nbsp;A lot of traders prefer to sell below bare bars.&nbsp;So some
traders would sell below this bear bar, others would take the short below this
doji bar.&nbsp;And same over here, you could sell below that bull bar or below
the bear bars.&nbsp;And here you can sell below the doji.&nbsp;You can sell
below the bear bar.&nbsp;In this video I talked about how I use the term
trend.&nbsp;I also talked about the importance of bull trends needing higher
lows and the importance of bear trends needing lower highs.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 26:05 As long as the bear trend is forming lower highs, traders believe
the premise of a bear trend is still valid.&nbsp;If the market gets above a
lower high and a bear trend, the bear trend probably has ended and has evolved
either into a trading range or less likely a bull trend.&nbsp;And the opposite
is true of a bull trend forming higher lows.&nbsp;If the market falls below a
major higher low, the bullshit probably has ended and has probably converted
into a trading range.&nbsp;This is Al Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you for watching the

<p class=MsoNormal>This is Al Brooks, and this is the second of five videos on
trends in the Brooks trading course.&nbsp;An important point when you're
looking at any chart is that if it's not particularly clear, the chart is in a
trading range.&nbsp;Next I want to talk about how trends can be in a breakout
phase or a channel phase.&nbsp;And the breakout phase is the strongest part of
a trend.&nbsp;And finally, I'll talk about the 80 rule.&nbsp;Markets have
inertia just as trading ranges.&nbsp;And to resist breaking out.&nbsp;80% of
breakout attempts fail within a trading range.&nbsp;When the market's in a
trend, it's constantly trying to reverse.&nbsp;But 80% of the reversal attempts
will fail.&nbsp;Look at this chart.&nbsp;We're strongly bearish.&nbsp;We're
strongly bearish again and again.&nbsp;And then we're strongly bullish and
again.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 01:13 So is the market in a trend?&nbsp;Well, if
it's not clearly in a trend, you have to assume it's in a trading
range.&nbsp;It's making strong bull breakout attempts, strong bear breakout
attempts.&nbsp;So there are good arguments for the bulls and for the
bears.&nbsp;It's one of the hallmarks of a trading range.&nbsp;Whenever the
market is not clear and both the bulls and the bears have reasonable arguments,
the market is in a trading range and you have to trade it like a trading
range.&nbsp;I said that every trading range has both bull and bear
arguments.&nbsp;Well, every trading range also contains the start of both bull
and bear trends.&nbsp;For example, look at this.&nbsp;We're getting lower
highs.&nbsp;And if this chart continued down, you would say that the bear trend
began here.&nbsp;Likewise here we got a double bottom.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane
02:04 Let's say we break above the neckline and go up for a measured move and
start a bull trend.&nbsp;And you look back at this chart and ask yourself where
did that bull trend begin?&nbsp;You would say here.&nbsp;However, at this point
right here, we're still in a trading range.&nbsp;So it has an early bull trend
and it has an early bear trend.&nbsp;In this particular case, we have lower
highs and we also have higher lows.&nbsp;Just as every trading range contains
trends contain trading ranges.&nbsp;Every pullback and pause is a small trading
match.&nbsp;And you can tell that by looking at a smaller time frame
chart.&nbsp;Here there's no actual pullback, but it's still pause in a
trend.&nbsp;Here is an actual pullback and a pullback is a small trading
range.&nbsp;So this is a small trading range.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 02:58 This
pullback is a small trading range.&nbsp;It extended on informed a 10 or a 15
bar trading range, yet we're still in a bull trend.&nbsp;Once a trading range
goes on for 20 bars or so, the probability of a reversal becomes almost as high
as the probability that the trend will resume.&nbsp;I always look to the left
and whatever to the left is, that's what is always going to be slightly more
likely the market will do at some point.&nbsp;So when I'm trading in here, when
I'm looking at the market here, it's confusing.&nbsp;Are the bulls or bears in
control?&nbsp;One of the most recent clearly always in setup was here.&nbsp;The
market was clearly always in law.&nbsp;So all through here the probability is
slightly higher.&nbsp;That will get trend resumption up instead of trend
reversal down.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 03:51 But every bar that gets added to the
trading range reduces the probability for the bulls.&nbsp;And at Some point
after 20, 30, 40 bars, the probability of trend resumption up falls to 50% and
the probability of trend reversal down rises to 50%.&nbsp;I talk about always
in trading.&nbsp;And if the market is clearly always in short, it's far easier
to make money selling.&nbsp;So it's better only to look to sell.&nbsp;We're trying
to reverse up repeatedly, but the channel is very tight.&nbsp;I don't have the
lines drawn, but it's a very tight bear channel.&nbsp;So all of these reversal
attempts are minor, which means they'll lead either to a bear flag or a trading
range.&nbsp;So traders look to sell every reversal down from a
pullback.&nbsp;This bar pulled back above that high, so it's a pullback below
one short.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 04:50 Here we pulled back for a few bars and
it's a short.&nbsp;Here.&nbsp;You can also call it a double top lower
high.&nbsp;And here we pull back for a few bars.&nbsp;So it's far easier to
make money selling when the market is clearly always in short.&nbsp;Also, it's
easier to make money if you swing trade.&nbsp;If you sell for any reason here
or here, it's better not to take quick profits.&nbsp;If you're a very skilled
trader and you can buy back your shorts and then sell again.&nbsp;Buy back your
shorts and sell again, you'll do fine.&nbsp;But very few traders can do
that.&nbsp;And when a channel down is this type, it's far better to take any
short and just hold until there's a clear end to the trend.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 05:37 For any trade, whether you're in a trend or in a trading range, you
should always have protective stocks.&nbsp;And they can't be simply in your
head.&nbsp;They have to be in the market.&nbsp;Let's say you buy above this
bar, you might immediately place a stop here.&nbsp;It's a 50 pullback.&nbsp;A
very strong reversal up high.&nbsp;Two by most bulls will not let it fall below
this bar.&nbsp;And if it does, they'll question whether it's still in a bull
trend.&nbsp;So the bull immediately pushes the stop there.&nbsp;The bears will
look at this and say, oh, were trending up and then we got a bull breakout
above this type of channel.&nbsp;So trying to get a bull breakout above the
type full channel, it's an exhaustion bar.&nbsp;Every big bull trend bar is an
exhaustion bar.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 06:22 And the gap close, the gap between
this close and that high closed it over here.&nbsp;So maybe the bull trend has
ended.&nbsp;And maybe we're in a trading range.&nbsp;Maybe we're in fact in a
bear trend.&nbsp;The bears will look at this as a lower high.&nbsp;Not enough
bars for a major reversal, but certainly enough bars for a minor reversal, the
swing down, and the bears will look at this as a double top below high.&nbsp;In
any case, the bulls who buy here cannot have a protective stock in their
heads.&nbsp;They have to have the spot in the market just below the load this
far.&nbsp;Because sometimes you get this.&nbsp;It happens often or not.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 07:02 And if you don't have that stop there taking you out,
you'll keep coming up with reasons why you should continue to hold on to your
long position, hoping that it will reverse up.&nbsp;And you cannot do
that.&nbsp;A breakout is the strongest type of trend.&nbsp;It can be one bar,
it can be many bars.&nbsp;The bars are really scary for beginners.&nbsp;They
look at this and market's not doing much of anything at all.&nbsp;So it's
pretty peaceful watching it.&nbsp;And then you suddenly have to change your way
of thinking when you see a big bar like this, far bigger than all the prior
bars, 10 times bigger, closing far above the high of all the other
bars.&nbsp;So we're no longer in a tight training range.&nbsp;You're now in a
trend.&nbsp;Very strong bull breakdown, high probability that we're going
higher.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 07:56 But here you could use very small
stops.&nbsp;The bars are small, the market sideways.&nbsp;Here you now have to
use a wide stop below that bar, below this bar, probably blow all of the
bars.&nbsp;It's very easy to miss the trade.&nbsp;You're denying that it's the
start of a trend.&nbsp;Well, chances are it is the start of the
trend.&nbsp;Chances are that means high probability that it's going to continue
higher high probability of a profit if you buy yet stop far below.&nbsp;So risk
is great.&nbsp;And that's always the case.&nbsp;Whenever you see something that
has a high probability of predicting something else, like higher prices, your
risk reward is going to be bad, usually your risk is big because the stop is
far away due to how fast the market moved up.&nbsp;You have to get one.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 08:46 Even if a small position, you have to get long.&nbsp;And
what I talk about in this course constantly is ways to get long.&nbsp;You have
to train yourself to react reflexively.&nbsp;You see this, you know the
market's no longer in a tight trading range.&nbsp;The market has
changed.&nbsp;You need to get long.&nbsp;And you can simply buy
closes.&nbsp;You can buy the close of the breakout bar if you want higher
probability.&nbsp;You wait to see if the next bar has a bull close and then you
buy that bull close.&nbsp;And how do you buy it?&nbsp;You just hit the button,
buy the market.&nbsp;Or you could place a limit order as soon as this bar
closes to buy at the close of that bar.&nbsp;But the easiest thing is you see
that second bar, having a bull close just hit by the market.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 09:29 Again, stop as far away.&nbsp;So you're risking a lot more
money.&nbsp;Have to trade smaller.&nbsp;You can put your stop below the breakout
bar.&nbsp;If this is going to be a successful breakout, it should not trade
below such an exceptional bar.&nbsp;You could also put it below the entire bull
light.&nbsp;Both are reasonable.&nbsp;And the odds are whenever you see a
breakout that is as big as this, it's going to result in some kind of a
measured move up.&nbsp;Maybe simply based upon the open of the bar to the close
of the bar measure move up here.&nbsp;But it certainly has at least a 60%
chance of resulting in higher prices in some kind of measurement.&nbsp;I think
one of the hardest things for a beginner is all they think about is
risk.&nbsp;I can't lose money.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 10:15 I work so hard to
get this account so that I can trade.&nbsp;And if I lose my money, I lose my
trading career.&nbsp;I die.&nbsp;My trading career has died.&nbsp;So all they
focus on is risk.&nbsp;And because of that, they're always looking for the
tightest possible stock.&nbsp;And they're also always waiting for pullbacks
because they think, well, I don't want to buy up here because my stop is too
big.&nbsp;I can't afford the risk that much.&nbsp;While they wait, the trend
can continue up a long way.&nbsp;They have to get used to just buying at the
market.&nbsp;They see the markets going up, tight channel.&nbsp;It's a breakout
on a higher time frame.&nbsp;You just buy at the market.&nbsp;Put a stop down
here, go for a walk for 15 minutes.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 10:58 And if that's
what you have to do to stay in the trend, because this tight bull channel is a
breakout on a higher time frame chart, that means the odds Are we're going
higher?&nbsp;That beginner now, his stop is all the way down here, so his wrist
is even greater.&nbsp;So he's even more afraid.&nbsp;And he's going to keep
waiting for a pullback instead of looking at the chart and saying, wow, this is
going up.&nbsp;And it may keep going up.&nbsp;I should just get long, you know,
the beginner just hoping for that pullback.&nbsp;And this is a whole
rally.&nbsp;If you are a bull and you're long for any reason, let's say you
bought somewhere down here, your stop is down here, and that stop is probably
much bigger than what you typically use.&nbsp;And that means your risk is
greater than normal.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 11:45 So what do you have to
do?&nbsp;Well, if you're a computer algorithm, you have to do something to make
sure that your risk does not get too big.&nbsp;The easiest thing to do is to
reduce your position size.&nbsp;So even in a strong bull trend, bulls have to
take profits at some point to reduce their risk.&nbsp;And when the bulls take
profits, it creates a bull flag.&nbsp;However, beginners don't see it that
way.&nbsp;When they see that pullback, they see a trend reversal.&nbsp;Reversal
into a bear trend.&nbsp;This is profit taking from the bulls, trying to
reverse, trying to reverse.&nbsp;See, it went up and down.&nbsp;Mostly profit
taking from the bulls.&nbsp;It's a mistake to be selling even with limit orders
when the channel is this tight.&nbsp;All of these reversals are mostly profit
taking from the bulls.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 12:34 And as soon as it comes down
a little bit, other bulls who have been waiting for a pullback are buying even
if it drops just one bar below the low, the other bar here, one bar below, one
bar below.&nbsp;Traders who are flat or who do not yet have a full position are
buying even the smallest pullbacks.&nbsp;That means there's a lot of urgency on
the part of the bulls.&nbsp;If you get a big enough pullback, what becomes a
major higher low, Computers will tighten their stops to blow that major higher
low.&nbsp;And then anyone who buys after that point, they have a stock that is
higher up, so the risk is less.&nbsp;So look at this trend.&nbsp;We have one
and two bar pullbacks all the way up, and they do not drop very far.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 13:23 And the market keeps working higher.&nbsp;The sell signal
bars do not look all that strong.&nbsp;When the bulls look at all of these
reversal attempts, what they see is a bull flag for me.&nbsp;And they're
looking for a reversal back up.&nbsp;So they're expecting the reversal down to
be just a bar or two.&nbsp;And the bulls will buy with stops above the reversal
bars.&nbsp;Beer Breakouts.&nbsp;And beginner looks at it and says, oh, it's
still too high for me to buy.&nbsp;I want more of a pullback.&nbsp;The beginner
does not take the trade.&nbsp;He says, you know, my shop still has to be down
here and I cannot risk that much.&nbsp;And what it should be doing is buying
small, just buying a tiniest position that you could buy at any point.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 14:06 Take any one of these high ones, little flags, and use the
appropriate shot.&nbsp;So the beginner ends up missing the trend that goes on
for 10, 20, 30, 40 bars.&nbsp;And the beginner oftentimes start to think, okay,
this is going on way too far.&nbsp;It's unsustainable, it's climactic, and
therefore it should reverse.&nbsp;The trend cannot last forever.&nbsp;All
strong trends are constantly forming.&nbsp;Wedges.&nbsp;One, two,
three.&nbsp;However, when the channel is this tight, all of those wedges are
going to fail.&nbsp;The beginner only sees the wedge.&nbsp;He doesn't see the
tight channel, and he does not see the low probability.&nbsp;So.&nbsp;So that
beginner who did not buy any of this now sees a reversal down.&nbsp;He says,
okay, lower, high, I gotta sell.&nbsp;Maybe we'll get leg one, leg two,
measured move down, leg one, two.&nbsp;And my stop is small.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 15:06 So if I sell below here, maybe my shop is here.&nbsp;So I'm not
risking very much.&nbsp;Yes, he's not risking very much, but is terrible
probability when you have a tight bolt channel like this.&nbsp;The first
reversal down is minor and the bulls will buy it.&nbsp;Here we have a first
reversal down, and guess what?&nbsp;Strong bulls are going to buy it.&nbsp;So
that beginner, who's been waiting for his pullback finally has his fullback,
and he's selling far below the high, far too much below the high.&nbsp;And he's
selling where smart bulls are just waiting to buy.&nbsp;So maybe the beginner
will sell this bear flag and put the stop just above the five bar because he
wants to reduce his risk.&nbsp;And that's just a terrible mistake because most
reversal attempts fail.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 15:55 And this, I think, is a
bull flag and more likely to go up.&nbsp;If it keeps going down for 20, 30 or
40 bars, then the probability is that we're in a bear trend, even though we did
not have a major trend reversal.&nbsp;But at least 70% of the time, you have a
channel this tight and you get a bear breakout, it's going to be a beer leg in
a trading range.&nbsp;And the beers will need a major trend reversal.&nbsp;In
other words, they'll need one more attempt to resume up Testing this high and
then a second entry short double top.&nbsp;There's reversal down and then a
rally, the second reversal done.&nbsp;Without that, chances are any reversal
attempt is going to be minor.&nbsp;The bulls from the buyer 80 rule.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 16:42 If the market's in a strong bull trend, it's always going
to be forming tops, usually wedge tops, but 80% of the tops will fail
here.&nbsp;We got different ways to draw a wedge top.&nbsp;Talked about that a
few minutes ago.&nbsp;And the beginner selling this lower high is betting on.&nbsp;Well,
maybe it's not quite a major reversal, but it's certainly big reversal after a
buy climax and therefore we should fall further.&nbsp;No, that's not
true.&nbsp;Very type old channel, first reversal down.&nbsp;Probably bulls will
buy it.&nbsp;Those were buying one bar pullbacks for 10, 20, 30 bars and now
they get a chance to buy a five bar or 10 bar pullback.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane
17:24 Well, a lot of them will take that chance if they were willing to buy a
one bar pullback and now they get to buy a much bigger pullback and there's no
clear convincing pop they're going to buy.&nbsp;So the bear selling down here
is selling at the bottom of what is at best a trading range and at worst might
be a pullback and a bull trend.&nbsp;Most of these tops become bull
flags.&nbsp;And here you can call this a wedge bull flag, you can call it a
high two, you can call it a small double bottom.&nbsp;Different ways to draw
the wedge.&nbsp;We got a slight pullback here.&nbsp;So first push down in a
doshi, the second push, third push.&nbsp;We can say first push down, second
push down, third push down, doesn't matter.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 18:07 A beer
channel is a bull flag, especially in a bull trend.&nbsp;Bulls are going to be
buying a reversal up from that.&nbsp;Your channel expecting the trench resume
up.&nbsp;So that bear who took this short below that bar and put his top just
above at this yellow line because he did not want to risk much lost money, the
probability was probably 80 that he was going to lose money.&nbsp;So yes, he
took a low risk trade.&nbsp;He did not lose money.&nbsp;But when he takes this
trade, he's going to lose 80% of the time and the 20 of the time that he wins,
he will not manage it well enough to overcome those losses.&nbsp;So the strong
bullshit, the first reversal down is a bull flag.&nbsp;Not every
reversal.&nbsp;Yes, the beginner says, okay, well at least I did not lose much.&nbsp;
S Stephen Crane 19:03 Well, if you lose a little bit of blood a thousand times,
you've lost a lot of blood.&nbsp;These small losses add up and you can end up
losing a lot of money.&nbsp;Now that beginner might think, okay, it's way
overdone and this didn't work.&nbsp;Now we got two legs up here.&nbsp;Maybe
it's a wedge.&nbsp;One, two, three, and maybe a second entry short up here is
worth taking while.&nbsp;It's a credible higher high.&nbsp;Major trend
reversal, bull trend, beer breakout lasting a lot of bars, you know, 10 or more
bars and then resumption up and you got a second leg up from here.&nbsp;This
was likely to have a second leg while we have it.&nbsp;So there are decent
reasons to sell, except one.&nbsp;Very tight bull channel.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 19:52 A very reversal is probably going to be a bull flag and we're going
to resume up.&nbsp;And how big are the pullbacks up here?&nbsp;Really
small.&nbsp;You can also call this a tight bull channel and therefore the
reversal down will probably fail.&nbsp;Even though this is a second entry cell,
first entry, second entry failed breakout, new high.&nbsp;It's still not enough
selling pressure.&nbsp;Where are the big bear bars?&nbsp;Where is the evidence
in the past 20, 30, 40 bars?&nbsp;Where's the evidence that the bears can take
control?&nbsp;This is not much evidence.&nbsp;Yes, it's a short and it's a
reasonable short, but it's a very low probability short.&nbsp;And I would not
take it.&nbsp;I've talked about this before as well.&nbsp;So you're taking a
short, your stop is above this bar.&nbsp;You say, well, at least my risk is
small.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 20:43 Whenever you have a very small risk, you
always will have low probability.&nbsp;In other words, anytime you take any
trade and you're using a very tight stop, you probably are going to get stopped
off for a loss.&nbsp;You can say, well, it's a major trend reversal, so if it
reverses down, I'll get a major profit, a very big profit.&nbsp;And that more
than offsets the low probability, which is true.&nbsp;But it assumes that a low
probability bet will be successful and that you'll manage it
correctly.&nbsp;And most beginners will not.&nbsp;They'll get out with a small
scalp profit, which means they're taking a small reward and that neutralizes
their small risk.&nbsp;So they still have a weak risk reward and they're taking
low probability bet.&nbsp;So low probability and not a strong risk reward setup,
you're going to lose money.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 21:44 What's going to happen
to this bear taking this low risk trade?&nbsp;He's probably going to get
stopped out and he did.&nbsp;Okay, that beginner might keep arguing, well, it's
gonna turn down at some point.&nbsp;It's way overdone.&nbsp;It just cannot keep
going up.&nbsp;Probability has to be getting higher.&nbsp;He knows.&nbsp;Low
probability, low probability, all you cared about was risk.&nbsp;He's assuming
that eventually the probability will go up and that he'll make money.&nbsp;Now
we got a wedge, maybe invested wedge, 1, 2, 3, 4.&nbsp;Nested into a larger
wedge.&nbsp;So that's certainly higher probability.&nbsp;And look, the risk is
small again.&nbsp;So if I sell below that doji, I get filled on this bear bar
and my risk again is small.&nbsp;But small risk usually means low probability
and a pretty tight bull channel.&nbsp;Low probability bulls probably will
buy.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 22:39 It's a credible higher high major trend
reversal short.&nbsp;I would not take it.&nbsp;Just not enough beer bars
anywhere on the screen to be selling, Especially selling with stops too far
below the high.&nbsp;That bear sells below this bar, this nested wedge.&nbsp;He
gets filled right there on this beer bar and he sees this bear.&nbsp;Barney's
happy, thinking that, okay, this is a higher probability short.&nbsp;It might
be, but it's still a terrible short.&nbsp;Chances are bulls will buy that bear
close and that will continue higher.&nbsp;Bulls will either buy the bear
clothes or they'll wait for a bull follow through bar.&nbsp;Bad follow through
a failed bear breakdown.&nbsp;And they'll buy just above that bull bar, betting
that the trend will continue.&nbsp;Like I said, 80% of reversal attempts in
both trends fail.&nbsp;Here, here.&nbsp;Just look at them all.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 23:39 Look at all these reversal attempts.&nbsp;Yet the channel up is
tight.&nbsp;There's an absence of big bear bars.&nbsp;The odds are every one of
these reversal attempts will fail and the trend will be going
higher.&nbsp;Unfortunately, a beginner will look at this and they'll keep
seeing wedges.&nbsp;Now we got a new wedge.&nbsp;One, two, either one of these
bars or three, and we're starting to get a pretty strong reversal down.&nbsp;So
maybe I'll sell that close or sell this close.&nbsp;Arguing discipline.&nbsp;I
have to be disciplined.&nbsp;I have to stick to my plan.&nbsp;My plan is that I
have to keep shorting this buy climax because it cannot last forever.&nbsp;And
my losses are small.&nbsp;Losses are part of trading.&nbsp;And certainly each
following reversal attempt will have higher and higher probability because
trends tend to weaken.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 24:28 And here we got a bull
breakup above a bull channel and a reversal down.&nbsp;So that's certainly
higher probability, but it's still a low probability bet.&nbsp;Trends just tend
to keep going up.&nbsp;And it's much better to keep buying bear closes, betting
that the trend will resume back up and that these reversals will fail.&nbsp;So
the beginner sees the bear bar sells here or sells here.&nbsp;Stop just above,
and he gets stopped out.&nbsp;The bull trend is just way too strong.&nbsp;The
pullbacks are too small.&nbsp;They're too brief and it's clearly still always
in one.&nbsp;Traders should only be looking to buy a huge bull trend
day.&nbsp;Yet the beginner lost money because he kept betting against the
trend.&nbsp;Trends are always trying to reverse.&nbsp;They're always forming
witch tops.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 25:19 But they also and go a lot further than
what traders think they possibly can do.&nbsp;So four losses, 1, 2, 3, 4 and
they add up to a big loss.&nbsp;So a trader lost money during a very strong
bull trend because he kept shorting all day, ignoring the low
probability.&nbsp;All he sees is the tight stop and small risk and therefore
I'm going to take the trade.&nbsp;But you need risk, reward and probability to
take a trade.&nbsp;And anytime you're taking a very low probability trade, by
definition, if it's low probability, when it's a high probability loss, you're
going to lose.&nbsp;Most of the time you will lose.&nbsp;So when a trend is
strong, clearly always in one, you should only be buying.&nbsp;Why do markets
exist?&nbsp;They exist for one reason.&nbsp;They allow people to trade at a
fair price.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 26:20 And although you thought the price was
too high, the buyers thought it was too low and it kept going higher.&nbsp;They
need someone to sell to them and you eagerly volunteer.&nbsp;You cannot do
that.&nbsp;Whenever a trend is very strong, you don't want to be the only
person selling.&nbsp;In fact, you don't want to be selling at all.&nbsp;You can
only look to buy.&nbsp;Markets are always trying to make traders
trade.&nbsp;That's part of why they exist.&nbsp;They're trying to facilitate
training, they want more training.&nbsp;So they're always doing things to make
people act.&nbsp;They're always going to be doing something that will make
traders uncomfortable and make them do something.&nbsp;For example, it makes
beginners short all the way up.&nbsp;However, it often has to go very far, much
further than what seems rational.&nbsp;And find out how far too far is.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 27:15 And how does it know that buyers stop buying, volume dries
up and one's willing to buy and then it'll start doing the opposite, it'll
start probing down.&nbsp;So as long as you keep selling, you'll have to keep
buying back with a loss and if it cannot go down, is going to keep going up
until there's no one left to buy.&nbsp;Once the final weak bears, like
beginners, stop selling, the strong bears begin to sell and you ultimately do
get a successful top.&nbsp;And there's no evidence of that happening on this
chart.&nbsp;So strong gold trend only with the buy.&nbsp;In this video I talked
about, when a chart looks unclear and you cannot tell if it's in a bull trend,
or a bear trend, it's in a trading range.&nbsp;So anytime something is not
clear, it's a training range.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 28:11 A breakout is the
strongest part of a trend and it's a high probability bet that the Trend will
continue.&nbsp;80 Rule Most reversal attempts fail.&nbsp;80% of reversal
attempts will fail.&nbsp;So instead of selling in a strong bull trend, you should
be buying.&nbsp;Instead of buying in a strong bear trend, you should only be
selling.&nbsp;I'm Al Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you for watching the Brooks Trading

<p class=MsoNormal>This is Al Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you for watching the Brooks
training course.&nbsp;This is the third of five videos on trends.&nbsp;I'm
going to begin by talking about the different types of trends.&nbsp;And then
I'm going to be talking about the bull and bear versions of the
trends.&nbsp;And finally I'm going to be talking about traps and
breakouts.&nbsp;Traps are failed breakouts.&nbsp;Trends are important because
they offer a lot of profit opportunity.&nbsp;But traders need to understand how
they operate.&nbsp;And for me a good starting point is classifying them into
different types of trends based upon their behavior.&nbsp;Every trend bar is a
breakout.&nbsp;Every series of trend bars is a breakout.&nbsp;So bull breakouts
here, bear breakout there, bear breakout here.&nbsp;And every trend is also
contained within a channel, although the channel sometimes is not particularly
obvious.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>01:24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have a rising wedge channel and we have a falling
channel that is also a wedge channel.&nbsp;A breakout.&nbsp;It can be a single
bar, it can be a series of bars.&nbsp;Trends are either in a breakout phase or
a channel phase.&nbsp;And a breakout is the strongest type of a trend.&nbsp;I
sometimes call it a spike.&nbsp;So I would call this a spike.&nbsp;And channel
will trend.&nbsp;And every trend bar is also a climax.&nbsp;Climax does not
mean the trend reverses or the trend even pauses.&nbsp;Sometimes the climax
just gets more climactic and the market just keeps going up.&nbsp;Every trend
is either a breakout or a channel.&nbsp;A channel is a weaker type of trend in
which there is two sided trading.&nbsp;So you get bulls in control for part of
it, pairs in control or another part of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>02:22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the way you draw channels, it's rarely perfect.&nbsp;The
lines are really perfectly corresponding to the points in the
channel.&nbsp;Every trend begins with a breakup, at least a small
breakup.&nbsp;Here we have a gap open, so here's the end of one session, the
start of another session, and we have a big gap down and the gap immediately
closed.&nbsp;The market had a series of bull trend bars closing on their
highs.&nbsp;Not much overlap between the bars.&nbsp;As soon as this bar closed,
a lot of traders just hit the button to buy the market and you can see the
over.&nbsp;The next bar did not fall below the close of this bar.&nbsp;And the
same thing here.&nbsp;There's a lot of urgency on the part of the bulls in this
particular breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>03:10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as this bar closed, traders did not place a limit
order to buy the close as soon as the bar closed by the market.&nbsp;And so the
low and open of this bar never fell below that close.&nbsp;So this is a strong
reversal up.&nbsp;And every trend bar or series of trend bars is a Breakout
does not matter that you do not see the breakout or understand what the
breakout is.&nbsp;But that's how you have to think of it.&nbsp;You can think of
this as a very steep bear trend and we broke above it.&nbsp;So I could draw a
trend line from this high to this high.&nbsp;And we're breaking above it, a
series of bull trend bars.&nbsp;Good sized bodies closing in their upper
halves.&nbsp;Here they're closing near their highs.&nbsp;And it could be one
bar, it could be many bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>03:56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We gap down, which is a bear breakout.&nbsp;And then we
reverse up bull breakout.&nbsp;This is a very strong breakout.&nbsp;Very strong
bull bars.&nbsp;No tails on the bottom, closes on the high, very small tails on
top.&nbsp;Sometimes a breakout is made up of less impressive trend
bars.&nbsp;For example, we have a breakout here and another breakout
here.&nbsp;And this one contained a doji small bar closing around its
middle.&nbsp;And this one had a doi here and again here.&nbsp;It's not as
strong as the other one, but it's still a breakout and it's still a strong bull
trend.&nbsp;You want to see most of the bull bars closing at least above their
midpoints, preferably at their highs.&nbsp;And it's stronger yet if there's
very little pullback below the close of the prior bar.&nbsp;Very little
overlap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>04:56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most bear trends begin with some kind of a
breakout.&nbsp;Here we've got a breakout.&nbsp;We have another breakout
here.&nbsp;Look at this bear trend.&nbsp;It's mostly beer bars closing below
their midpoints or near their lows.&nbsp;And we have several series of
consecutive bear trend bars.&nbsp;So that's relentless selling.&nbsp;And look
at this bar.&nbsp;As soon as it closed, traders hit the button.&nbsp;Sell, sell
the market.&nbsp;Look at the open and high of this bar.&nbsp;Did not get above
that close.&nbsp;So this urgency all the way down.&nbsp;Very little overlap, very
little overlap.&nbsp;And that increases the chances that the market will go
lower.&nbsp;Sometimes a small breakout can lead to a big trend.&nbsp;This is
the Euro versus a dollar, a ten minute chart.&nbsp;Now look at this.&nbsp;This
time on the bottom.&nbsp;This is a 10 minute chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>05:51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And there's price on the vertical axis.&nbsp;It's a two
dimensional chart.&nbsp;Price and time.&nbsp;It's easy to think that breakouts
have to begin with price.&nbsp;Only a big move in price.&nbsp;Well, they
don't.&nbsp;Breakouts can take place over time made up of lots of small bars,
as is the case here.&nbsp;After 20 or 30 bars you have to conclude that even
though we're not getting huge bars, it's still a bear trend.&nbsp;Look how
tight the channel is.&nbsp;Look how small the pullbacks are.&nbsp;They do not
go up very far.&nbsp;They only last one, two or three bars.&nbsp;And on a
higher time frame chart.&nbsp;This is a strong breakout.&nbsp;We have a little
breakout here.&nbsp;A gap between this high follow through bar and this
low.&nbsp;The bar before this small breakout bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>06:42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can get a small breakout and it can lead to a relentless
trend that can go on a long time and channel.&nbsp;Here the channel is maybe 30
bars without a pullback.&nbsp;Whenever you see an endless pullback like this,
we have a bull trend.&nbsp;And initially the bull saw it as a pullback, yet
it's a never ending pullback.&nbsp;It's an endless pullback and once you get 20
or 30 bars down, you have to be thinking at some point the bulls give up and
you can get a big bear breakout.&nbsp;That becomes a measuring gap.&nbsp;At
least true measure move.&nbsp;Down here, the bulls finally gave up.&nbsp;So
it's no longer a beer channel bull flag, it's now a bear trend.&nbsp;We have a
big breakout bar and a big follow through bar.&nbsp;Typically that's what
happens when you have an endless pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>07:34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And finally the bulls give up.&nbsp;Usually you get a pair
of big bear bars closing near their lows and it usually becomes a measuring gap
and the market typically falls for a measured move.&nbsp;Down here we have what
the bulls think is the bull flag, but it just keeps growing and
growing.&nbsp;And then we have a breakout below the bottom of what was a bull
flag.&nbsp;And the market fell for about a measurement down was no longer a
bull flag.&nbsp;Once these two bars come, and now everyone concludes that it's
a severe trend and it probably will fall further and this probably will end up
as a measuring gap.&nbsp;There are many different types of trends and they
behave differently.&nbsp;So it's good to distinguish the differences among the
different trends because you trade them slightly differently.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>08:24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In general, especially if you're starting out, it's better
to only swing trade once you think the market is going up.&nbsp;Here we got a
bull breakout and small double bottom.&nbsp;This bar, that bar, a bullet
close.&nbsp;So you buy there and you stay long until there's a good reason to
get out.&nbsp;And this is not a good reason.&nbsp;Neither is this triangle
three pushes up 1, 2, 3.&nbsp;And these reversals are not strong enough for the
bears to take control.&nbsp;So the both hold.&nbsp;You need a good reason to
exit, and these are not good reasons to exit.&nbsp;Trends behave the same on
all time frames and it doesn't matter what time frame you're using on intraday
charts.&nbsp;I use some names that are different, but there are corresponding
types on the daily chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>09:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So sometimes if we gap down here and just started trending
up from the open, I would call it a trend from the open bull trend on a daily
chart.&nbsp;Instead, I would probably just call it a tight bull
channel.&nbsp;And if this were a 5 minute chart and this was the open of the
day, I would just call it a trend for the open bull trend or possibly a small
pullback.&nbsp;Bullshit.&nbsp;Now look at this chart.&nbsp;We have a spike
pullback and you call the whole thing a channel or you call it another spike and
channel or another spike and channel.&nbsp;And just about every trend at some
point has a spike and channel pattern as a breakout and then a channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10:08</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If this is a gap down open or if this is the open of the day
and we did this, you could call it a trend from the open bull trend.&nbsp;It's
clearly the spike and channel bull trend.&nbsp;And again, almost all trends
have some component of a spike and channel to them.&nbsp;But if this is a trend
from the open bull trend, they happen about once a week on an intraday
chart.&nbsp;It could also be a trending trading range day where the market
breaks out and then forms a big trading range.&nbsp;Although in this case it
has not yet formed a trading range.&nbsp;You can argue there's a trading range
here, trading range there, and it's a trending trading range
day.&nbsp;Typically a trending trading range day just has a couple trading
ranges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10:49</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if you start to get four trading ranges like this, I
don't use that term trending trading range day.&nbsp;Instead I would call it a
spiking channel bull trend.&nbsp;I would call it a trend from the open bull
trend.&nbsp;If this is the open, it clearly trended from the open.&nbsp;And I
would also call it a spike and channel bull trend where this is a spike and
then channel made another spike within this channel on another channel.&nbsp;Is
it a broad bull channel?&nbsp;Well, it's fairly broad, so you can also call it
a broad bull channel.&nbsp;And there are other types of bright bull channels
like wedges and stairs.&nbsp;If it's a small pullback bull trend, this is
really not a good example because the pullbacks are too deep.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11:33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Small pullback bull trends are the strongest types of bull
trends and they occur a couple times a month.&nbsp;This is I think more of a
spiking channel bull trend spike here, or you can say the whole thing is a
spike and then shrink the channel up.&nbsp;And I would not call it the trending
trading range today.&nbsp;It's also a broad channel, the pullbacks are fairly
deep and it spends a lot of time going sideways.&nbsp;That's characteristic of
a broad channel.&nbsp;On the downside, we have a bear breakout and then a
channel compare breakout pullback here, bigger pullback here and then a channel
again.&nbsp;Most bear trends have a spike in channel bear trends within
them.&nbsp;If this is the open of the day, then it's also a trend from the open
bear trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here we have a trend and a trading range and the bear
trend resumed.&nbsp;It's also a trend resumption bear trend.&nbsp;All bear
trends have a spike in channel component.&nbsp;Is this trending trading range
day?&nbsp;Not really.&nbsp;We only have one trading range.&nbsp;We have a
breakout did not form a second trading range.&nbsp;Is it a broad bear
channel?&nbsp;Well, not really.&nbsp;You can argue that this is a broad bear
channel.&nbsp;But to me this is more of a strong breakout trading range and another
strong breakdown.&nbsp;Is there a small pullback bull trend?&nbsp;No, this
pullback is too deep for this to be a small pullback full time.&nbsp;I would
call this a spike and channel bear trend.&nbsp;If you want, you can call it a
trend resumption bear trend.&nbsp;Let me talk a little bit more about bull and
bear trends.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13:14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many ways to classify trends, but usually one is the
dominant type on the chart.&nbsp;If this is the open of the day, you've got a
spike in channel bull trend.&nbsp;You can call the trend from the open bull
trend.&nbsp;You can call it a tight bullshit.&nbsp;That is pretty
tight.&nbsp;You can also call it a trending trading range day.&nbsp;We have a
trading range, a brief breakout and another trading range.&nbsp;The pullback
overlapped the lower range and then we resumed up again.&nbsp;All trends begin
with some kind of a breakout and then it has a pullback here.&nbsp;Or you can
call this whole thing a pullback and then you get a channel.&nbsp;So here we
have a breakout, a spike and then we have a channel.&nbsp;And again, sometimes
it's not obvious what the channel is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13:58</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did the channel begin here to begin here?&nbsp;Did it begin
there?&nbsp;Doesn't matter.&nbsp;Some computers will use any of
those.&nbsp;Three beer trends also usually can be classified more than one
way.&nbsp;This is a good example of a small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;If this
is the open of the day, it's a trend from the open bear trend.&nbsp;Very tight
channel here.&nbsp;So it's a breakout on a higher time frame.&nbsp;It's a spike
in channel bear trend.&nbsp;Look at the pullbacks.&nbsp;They only last a bar or
two and the market just continues down in a very tight channel.&nbsp;So it's a
tight bear channel and it's also A I think a small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;I
would call this a small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;All the pullbacks are really
small.&nbsp;It's the strongest type of bear trend on a higher time frame
chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14:49</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This entire sell off is a breakout, a bear breakout again, a
bear micro channel lasting about 10 bars or so.&nbsp;It's a breakout on a
higher time frame chart.&nbsp;It's a spike and then we have a pullback and then
a channel.&nbsp;So it's a type of spike and channel bear trend.&nbsp;And all
trends have some component of spiking channel bear trend to them.&nbsp;But this
is mostly a small pullback bear trend and it's better to only short.&nbsp;I
want to talk a little bit about getting trapped into bad trades, getting
trapped out of good trades.&nbsp;Talk a little bit about breakouts as
well.&nbsp;At some point you look at this and say, it's a bull trend,
right?&nbsp;So if it's a bull trend, don't sell, don't be selling highs, don't
be selling reversals down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Especially a trend like this where the pullbacks are so
small, so it's really easy to get trapped into shorts you sell and immediately
reverses up, trapping you into a loss.&nbsp;It's also easy to get trapped out
of lungs.&nbsp;You say, well dojis bear bars, it doesn't look all that strong
away for deeper pullback to buy.&nbsp;And the market just keeps going
up.&nbsp;Beginners, they love to sell bull trends.&nbsp;Oh, maybe we're
reversing biclimax.&nbsp;We have a double top here, we have a wedge here, we
have another wedge here.&nbsp;They're always looking for reasons to
sell.&nbsp;And there's only one reason why they are selling.&nbsp;It's because
they are afraid of risk.&nbsp;They equate losing their account with death, the
death of their dream as a trader.&nbsp;And so all they focus on is
risk.&nbsp;They do not focus on probability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16:31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's a terrible mistake because some days are small
pullback bull trends or strong bull trends.&nbsp;And yes, the risk shorting is
low, small.&nbsp;So you sell below this bar and you're not risking much, but
you keep losing.&nbsp;Yes, the risk is low, but the probability is extremely
low.&nbsp;It's impossible to make money or consistent money selling in strong
bull trends.&nbsp;Okay, so beginners keep selling saying, oh, I'm not risking
much selling, not risking much.&nbsp;But all of those small losses add
up.&nbsp;And anytime you're taking a trade with low risk, you also are taking a
trade with low probability.&nbsp;And it's very difficult to make money if the
probability is very low.&nbsp;As it is selling the strong bull trend, you just
keep getting stocked out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17:22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beginners only think about risk and therefore they end up
only selling when the market's in a bull trend because the risk is
small.&nbsp;And they only end up buying in a bear trend because the risk is
small.&nbsp;And they totally ignore probability.&nbsp;And they end up losing
money because the probability is too low to be able to trade
profitably.&nbsp;Once you think the trend is up, don't get trapped into
repeated shorts.&nbsp;Don't be selling.&nbsp;You just keep looking for buy
opportunities.&nbsp;And strong bull trends rarely have good looking buy
opportunities.&nbsp;This is not a good looking high one.&nbsp;Neither is
this.&nbsp;That's not a good looking high.&nbsp;Two, we're going to be reversal
in the doshi.&nbsp;Not good looking, but the single bars, even though they do
not look good, typically they're reliable.&nbsp;The probability is high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18:12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So experts buy and they just decide where the correct stop
is.&nbsp;Bull breakout.&nbsp;Not much of a strong bull breakout here.&nbsp;So
the stop is still down here.&nbsp;So you gotta buy.&nbsp;You gotta allow for
the possibility of a deep pullback.&nbsp;But you have to buy and you just use
the correct stock and trade small.&nbsp;Every time you see the market trying to
resume back up, you buy and the stop is way down here.&nbsp;So you trade
smaller.&nbsp;And then after you get a strong bull breakout like this, then
this becomes a major higher low.&nbsp;You can raise your stock from here up to
there.&nbsp;So when you're buying over here, your stop is now down
here.&nbsp;In beginners, they don't buy because even buying here, for them the
stop is too far.&nbsp;They don't want to risk that much.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19:02</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So they keep shorting where the stock is closer and they
keep losing because the probability is so low.&nbsp;Look at this strong bear
trend.&nbsp;You can only sell, but it's really easy as a beginner to get
trapped into longs.&nbsp;You keep buying, betting that the reversals will give
you at least a scalp.&nbsp;And you're buying because the risk is
small.&nbsp;Maybe you buy above this bar, this bullet side bar for a stop just
below and you say, okay, I got stopped off and did not lose much money.&nbsp;But
if you do it again here and here and here, you end up losing a lot of money, a
lot of small losses and out to a lot of money.&nbsp;And then beginners, they
also get trapped out of taking shorts because they keep waiting for bigger
pullbacks to sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19:51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And they never get short.&nbsp;A strong trend like this
traps beginners into longs.&nbsp;They keep buying because they're concerned
that they don't want to Take trades for the shop is far away and they never
short because they know the stop is way up here and they don't want to risk
that much.&nbsp;Only focusing on risk and ignoring probability, you will lose
money.&nbsp;The trader's equation has three variables.&nbsp;Risk, reward and
probability.&nbsp;Beginners typically only think about risk and they're buying
constantly.&nbsp;Even in a very strong bear trend.&nbsp;They just keep buying
reversals up and they get quickly trapped into zooms back down and eventually
they wipe their account out.&nbsp;In a strong bear trend, the signal bars
rarely look good.&nbsp;You want to sell below that bull bar.&nbsp;Well, it's
not that good looking a shell, but it's a strong bear trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20:50</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All of this bull bar small boshy, the cell setups never look
all that good.&nbsp;However, the chance of a reversal up is small.&nbsp;And if
you do get a reversal up, it'll be minor and you'll test back
down.&nbsp;Experienced traders use the appropriate stock sell at any time, any
reason, and they take these sell signals.&nbsp;Even with the bad sell signal
bars, knowing that the odds are if the market goes up, it will not go up that
r.&nbsp;So when you're trading in a strong bear trend and you're looking to
short, you can sell at the market, you can sell the stops.&nbsp;But if you're
taking stop entry shorts, which is fine and most beginners should do that, the
cell setups never look good enough.&nbsp;Yet the market continues down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21:37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The key is using the correct stuff, which means risking more
than you might like to risk.&nbsp;However, that's the only way to trade
this.&nbsp;Use the correct stock and trade very small beginners.&nbsp;They
don't sell because they don't want to use a stop that far away.&nbsp;The risk
is too big.&nbsp;And because they are so afraid of a stock this far away, they
get trapped out of very profitable shorts and they miss the entire
trend.&nbsp;Let's see a bear channel immediately.&nbsp;Bear channel.&nbsp;5%
chance it's going to be a bull breakout.&nbsp;25 chance there'll be a bear
breakout and the trend will accelerate downward.&nbsp;We have a spike down
micro channel or breakout.&nbsp;Higher time frame and then a channel.&nbsp;So
channel usually evolves into a trading range.&nbsp;75 chance you're going to
get a break above this trend line.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22:40</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think of every bear channel as a bull flag.&nbsp;Even if
it's a bear channel and a bear trend.&nbsp;Because 75 of the time you're going
to get a bull breakdown.&nbsp;Usually not as dramatically bullish as this, but
still 75 of the time a beer channel is a bull flag.&nbsp;You get A full
breakdown.&nbsp;Typically you have a spike in channel bear trend like
this.&nbsp;The spike and channel get the bull breakout.&nbsp;It tests around
the beginning of the channel.&nbsp;Here went quite a bit above.&nbsp;And then
you end up evolving into a trading range.&nbsp;So down and up and then down and
sideways.&nbsp;Then after you have the trading range, the market again decides
on the direction of the breakup, up or down and it can be in either
direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23:35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anytime I see a bull channel, I think bear flag 75 chance
you get a bear breakout.&nbsp;Does it become a bear trend?&nbsp;Not
necessarily.&nbsp;It can break out simply by going sideways.&nbsp;But full
channel bear flag 75 chance of a bear breakout.&nbsp;So I always think of every
bull channel as a bear flag expecting a bear breakout and a conversion into a
change, sometimes into a bear trend as it was here.&nbsp;And usually the market
tries to test the beginning of the channel which is down here.&nbsp;And you can
see it fell below the bottom of the channel before the buyers came
back.&nbsp;And so typically you get a bull channel and then a bear breakdown
and a conversion into a trading range.&nbsp;And at that point the market
decides whether to break out again to the upside or to the downside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> This is the fourth of five videos on trends. I'm going to
be describing three types of trends in this video. The first is a trend that
begins on the open. The next I'll talk about trending trading ranges. And
finally I think I'll talk about trends that are broad channels. When I talk
about a trend from the open, I don't necessarily mean a trend from the first
bar of the day, although it often begins with the first bar. In general, the
first bar of the day has a 20% chance of being either the high or low of the
day. When you have a trend from the open like this, the more bars that get
added to it, the more likely this ends up as the low of the day. Here we had a
gap up. I'm not showing much of yesterday. Only two bars we have a gap up and
then the first two bars are bull bars. That alone is enough for me to think of
the day as always in long. That is enough to make me think that the market's in
a bull trend. Even though both bars have tails, one of them has a body that's
at least half as big as the entire bar. Plus it's a pretty good sized body. The
trend continued. Traders were buying all the way up and we had an 11 bar bull
micro channel. No bear bars, no pullbacks for the first 11 bars. They also
started to get consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. And when you get
that on the open like this, the odds are 60% or greater. You're going to get
some kind of a measured move up, for example, based upon maybe the open of the
first bar to the close of the second bar of the breakout and measured move up
takes us to around there. When you see that on the open, a gap up and then one
bar, two bar, three bars, all bull bars. And then you start getting breakout
bars. There's a sense of urgency and that's usually a sign that you're at the
start of what will become a strong bull trend. First 11 bars traders bought at
or above the low of the prior bar. They were not even waiting for pullbacks.
Everyone was so eager to buy that they were buying at the market at the close
of the bar. They were hoping to buy below the low of the prior bar, but the
market for 11 bars did not trade below that prior bars low. When you have a lot
of urgency on the open like this, very strong breakout lasting about an hour or
so, market then usually goes sideways for several hours and then decides
between trend reversal down and trend resumption up. Here the market was in a
trading range for three hours. At the end of the day we got a little trend
resumption up. When you're trading the Forex market, the open is rarely ever
exact. Some days the move, for example in the United States session it might
begin at 5:30, other days might begin at 6:30, other days, 5:00 or 4:45. So
when I'm talking about the trend from the open, I'm usually talking about a
market that has a single session and a clear open like the stock market or the
day session of the E Mini. I usually do not use the phrase trend from the open
when I'm referring to the forest market or any other 24 hour market. These are
open basically 24 hours a day and the sessions overlap and the start of the
sessions is usually not the same. Every day there's often a breakout on a
report around the start of the session and I end up using some other term to
describe the trend. For example here I just simply call it a breakout. We have
a bull breakout and then a channel. For me this is a a bull spike and channel
pattern. And it was also a small pullback bull trend. The pullbacks were very
small. Rather than calling this a trend from the open, I would call it a spike
and channel. The Forex market really only has one clear open a week, but has
three sessions every day. Each of the three sessions can have a trend from the
open of the session, although that open is not necessarily exactly the same
time every day. For example, here for the Euro versus the $5 minute chart, the
start of the session usually corresponds to the start of when financial markets
start to get active. And that is around 5:30 in the morning Pacific time, 8:30
in the morning eastern time. When you get a big move like this, you can call it
a trend from the open bear trend. But since it can begin at different times on
any given day, I would rather simply call it a breakout. Here's again the Euro
versus the dollar and here's the start of the European session Attack trading
range, a pretty unremarkable start. However it became the high of the session.
You have a small bear bar and very bad follow through. There's some hesitation
on the open, some lack of certainty. It could still be a trend from the open
beer trend, even though it's beginning with very quiet two sided trading range
type of price action. If I were to use the phrase trend from the open in this
market, I would call this a trend from the open bear trend. And it's still
trending down from the open even though it's sideways. And then it's starting
to enter a tight bear channel. A much stronger bear trend, a breakout on a
higher time frame chart. We have a nine bar bear micro channel. Five of the
beer bars have big bodies and they close near their lows. And there are three
consecutive strong bear bars here. So this is the beginning of what will
probably result in at least some kind of a measure. Move down maybe based upon
the height of this breakout takes us down here, maybe further. In fact, it did
go further. Do you want to call this a trend from the open beer trend? Here's
the start of the US session. You can, I would simply call it a tight channel
bear trend or a breakout on a higher time frame chart. In any case, it's a
Strong enough trend. 9 Bar Bear micro channel. Several strong bear bars. The
odds are we're going at least a little bit lower. The bears are eager to sell.
They're not waiting for pullbacks. They're selling before there is a pullback.
So they're not trying to sell above the high of the prior bar. They're selling
at the market. They're selling bear closes. They're very eager to sell. And if
everybody's eager to sell, chances are even a small pullback traders will be
eager to sell it. They were willing to sell even without pullbacks. And when
they finally do get a pullback, you know, the odds are high that rather than a
reversal up, it's going to be a bear flag and that will probably go at least a
little bit lower. I now want to talk a little bit about trending trading
ranges. A trend made up of a series of trading ranges. When I see a trading
range like this on the open of the market and the trading range is about half
of the height of an average day's range, I'm assuming that today's range will
be like an average day's range and that the range will double. They can double
pry going up for a measured move. It can double by going down for a measured
move, or it can double by going a little bit down, a little bit up, a little
bit down, a little bit up and remaining a training range day. When a day does
become a trending trading range day, you have an initial range about half of an
average day's range in height and then you have a breakout. And the breakout is
usually fairly brief. Sometimes a single bar, sometimes five bars, sometimes
six or seven bars, but it's brief. And then the market starts to Enter another
trading range. This is a good example of a trending trading range. Today we
have a trading range, a brief breakout for a few bars and then another trading
range 60% of the time. When you have a trending trading range day like this, in
this case we have a bear trending trading range day, the market comes back up
at least a little bit into the other range. A bear trending trading range day.
I'm expecting that the market will at some point come at least a little bit above
the bottom of the upper range 60% of the time that happens. 40% of the time it
does not, and the market either stays sideways or goes down for another. Like
all trading ranges, once you have a trading range, you got to be thinking
breakout mode. And the breakout can go in either direction. Here we have a
trend reversal. So bear trend trading range, bear flag. But instead of a bear
breakout, we're getting a bull breakout in general. Once the trading range
extends for about 20 bars, this one's a little bit less. Once it extends for
about 20 bars, the probability of the bull breakout is just as high. As for the
bear breakout, it's basically a 5050 market. Again, 60% chance that the lower
range will come back above the bottom of the upper range by at least a little
bit. The breakouts when you have a trending trading range today usually last 3,
4, 5 bars, 6 bars and then you start to get signs of another range. You can see
here we have a couple bull bars and then a bear bar. A bull bar and then do.
Looks like at this point we're probably going to enter another range and the
day will be a trending trading each day. Once you get a 20 bar trading range,
there's a 50, 50 chance that you'll get a downside breakout. A trend reversal
50, 50 chance you'll get an upside breakout trend resumption. The market is
searching for a fair price. It's trying this and traders decide that the price
is too low. So we rally up in a pretty strong full micro channel. And the rally
is a search for sellers. Not enough sellers here. The market has to go higher
to find sellers. I said 60% of the time the range overlaps the range before.
Well, look at this. The bottom of this range did not overlap the top of this
range and that's a sign that the bulls are a little bit stronger. However, we
got this breakout and formed another range. The upper range did overlap the
lower range quite a little bit. Every time you get a reasonably strong
breakout, the market is telling you that the price is still too low. It has to
find sellers and it has to go higher to find them. Again, I mentioned that in
this particular case, Even though there's a 60 chance the range will overlap
the prior range, there's a 40% chance it will not. And here we have a gap. The
top of the lower range and the bottom of the upper range, a sign of strong
bulls. The bears were unable to close the gap and it increases the chances that
we're going higher. So when you're starting to get this breakout, you have to
assume this actually better than a 5050 chance that the breakout will be successful.
Here we do have overlap. The third trading range overlaps the second and it's a
sign that the trend is weakening. Strong bear breakout, bare micro channel, a
lot of consecutive be bars closing neither lows. Chances are we're going at
least a little bit lower. Maybe this is a little bit lower, maybe this is a
little bit lower. But big down, big up, probably trading range. And then we
have another be breakout lasting a few bars. In fact only one or two bars below
the low of the upper range. As usual, 60% chance the top of the lower range
will overlap the bottom of the upper range by at least a little bit. Then after
20 to 30 bars, it's in breakout mode and you can get trend resumption down or
trend reversal up. The probability of the two is about the same after about 20
or 30 bars. In this particular case, the market decided that the price was too
low and had to go higher to find sellers. This is common. At the end of the
session, the market decides, will the bear trend resume? Will it reverse like
it did here, or will it simply continue sideways into the end of the day? You
can see videos on trading ranges and trading the end of the day for more
information about what takes place at the end of the session. Again, the Euro
versus the dollar. A five minute chart. There's actually a wedge bottom here.
Can you see it? Three pushes down. One, two, three. I know the second push
falls below the line connecting the first and third, but that's common. We have
a bear trend. And then late in the bear trend after 20, 30 bars. Here, after 50
or 60 or 70 bars, the market enters a triangle. Triangles rarely are perfect,
but this is one way to draw it. A high. A second push, a third push again, does
not matter that the second is above the first. The overall idea is that we're
narrowing, we're getting to a narrower, tight training range. And we have at
least three pushes up or down. You can argue three down. A bull breakout that
reversed. Then you can restart the count. One, maybe two, and then three. In
any case, it's a breakout board situation. When you do get a triangle late in a
trend, here we go, a bear train. And you get trend resumption. You have to
think that the odds are usually 60 or 70% that the triangle will be the final
bear flag and that it will lead to a reversal, as it did here and it did in the
form of a wedge. Probably will get at least two legs sideways to up one
pullback too. I'm finally going to be talking about trends that are in broad
channels. We're in a bear trend and we have deep pullbacks, but in general
still forming lower highs and lower lows. It's a stairs pattern. Here's the
breakout, but the pullback goes above the bottom of the breakout. There's the
breakout point. And the pullback goes above the breakout point. And all the way
down there's the breakout point. And we have a pullback. Above the bottom of
the breakout point. There's another breakout and it reversed up back above the
bottom of the breakout. And when the pullbacks overlap the breakout points, I
call it a stairs pattern. We're stair stepping down. Pullback above the
breakout point, pullback above the breakout point. So that's a stairs pattern
and that's important to recognize. That tells you that bulls who are buying at
this low and scaling in lower are making money. And that is a sign of a weak
trend and a sign that the market will probably enter a trading range before too
long. A broad bear channel always has 20 or 30 bars in it that are also in our
trading range. And a lot of times when you look at the chart, you're not sure
if it's in a bear trend or in a trading range or if the bear trend has ended
and convert it into a trading range. When you're not sure whether it's still a
bear trend, a bear channel or a trading range does not matter. You trade it
like a trading range. You look to buy low, sell high and scalp. So you buy low,
buy in the bottom third and you scalp somewhere in the middle. On rallies, when
they reverse down, you sell that. Since we still are in a bear trend, you can
swing trade the sell offs, the bear entries. But in general, a lot of traders
simply scalp them because they're not sure whether the trading range will
continue for a lot more bars and they'd rather just sell and scalp. Sell and
scalp. Sell and scalp. A lot of times when the market is selling off like this
and then you enter a trading range, you're not sure what's going on. Are we
forming a wedge? Are we forming a lower low? Major trend reversal? Are we
forming a trading range? We're getting lower highs and lower lows. The answer
is all of that. It's obviously still in a beer trend, it's obviously in a
trading range and it's obviously forming a wedge bottom and a lower low. Major
trend reverse. Because it is still in a bear trend, a lot of traders will swing
at least part of their position when they're selling for the longs. We're not
yet in a bull trend, so any long is a scalp. So traders taking counter trend
positions here the trend is down. So the counter trend position is buying and
bear trends. So when you're buying, you're buying only for a scalp. Traders
will sell reversals down from the top of the channel. The channel, it rarely is
exact. Sometimes on television or on the web, you'll see channels that look
perfectly parallel. But that's not how channels typically look. The channels
are really exact. You have to keep redrawing the lines and anytime the market
is near the top of the channel, look to sell reversals down. We're in a bare
trend, so it's less important to buy reversals up from new lows. Although when
traders see a lot of two sided price action and they start to see pullbacks
going above breakout points, a lot of traders will buy reversals up from new
lows. For scalps, three pushes down, 1, 2, 3 second entry for a failed breakout
below a prior low common in trading rangers. So some bulls will buy that at
least for a scalp, double top bear flag and a bull breakout. You can say head
and shoulders, bottom left shoulder, head right shoulder. However, we're still
in a bear trend and you have to be ready for the bull breakout to fail. When
you have a double top and a bull breakout that fails, I think of that as a
variation of a wedge. We have three pushes up, one, two for the double top bear
flag and then the bull breakout is the third push. For me. Functionally this is
the same as a wedge bear flag. And I'm expecting at least a couple like
sideways to down one pullback too. A reasonable sell. They'll break out above a
double top bear flag, another lower high in a bear trend. A decent sell signal
bar traders at this point redraw the channel. That way we got a breakout above
the channel, another reversal down. Traders will sell below that bar. Even
though It's a bull bar. We have another double top bear flag and a bear
channel. A new low stair stepping down. Traders will buy a reversal up or
they'll simply buy at that low and then they're willing to buy more lower
again. When you're buying in a bear trend or in a trading range, it's better
only to scalp. After every reversal down, you redraw the line. And then when
you test that new line, traders will look to sell a reversal down again. After
every new high, you draw a new line and you see how the market behaves at that
line. Can you sell a reversal down here or reversal down there? You can draw
the line that way, you can draw the line this way, or you can simply say
another new low and a broad fair channel. So traders should buy reversals up or
they simply buy at that higher low, looking for a scalp. Bears, they also look
to sell somewhere in the middle of the last bear leg. So we have a bear leg.
Here's the middle third of that fair leg. Traders will look to sell somewhere
in the middle third. For example, a breakout into the middle third. And then we
have a bear bar reversing down. So traders will sell below there or below here.
Another bare leg starting here or here. This is the middle third. Traders will
look to sell somewhere in the middle third if they get a reversal down. For
example, we're breaking out to the upside. Traders will look to sell below the
lower bar, betting that a pullback to the middle third of the prior bear leg
will result in another lower high. We're getting lower highs. The same here.
Most recent pair, like traders look for a pullback somewhere to the middle of
that barrel leg. And then they sell reversal down, expecting another new low in
the bear trend. And bears take profits at the prior lows. So the bears who sell
here will take at least partial profits at the prior low. The bears sell here,
they'll take profits around the prior low. Bears to sell here, they'll take
profits around the prior low. Bulls who buy, they're looking to scalp out
somewhere in the middle third where the bears are going short. So for example,
a bull who places a limit or goodbye at the slow he gets filled, he'll look to
sell take profits for a scalp somewhere in the middle third. And one way to do
it is either with a limit order at a certain number of ticks or pips or simply
sell the reversal down. Take your profits there. A bull buying at this low sees
the market continuing down. However, he's confident that because we're in A
stairs pattern. We're going to get back above this breakout point. So some of
the bulls who buy here will buy more down here. Their second purchase is at
least the size of a typical scalp because if it does continue down like this, a
lot of them will try to get out or on their first entry break even on their
first and with the scalp on their second. So they want to make sure that that
second entry is at least the size of a scalp below the first. So you buy here,
buy more here, and then look to exit around the original entry. Bears, they're
looking to sell around the middle third. Anytime there's a reversal down here
we have a breakout and a pullback below the breakout, a breakout and a pullback
below the breakout. So it's a stairs pattern. But what do you notice about the
stairs pattern? The size of this breakout from this high to that high is less
than the size of the breakout from this high to that high. So the stairs are
shrinking. The bulls are less confident that the market's going to continue
higher. So the quicker to take profits, the bears are more confident that it's
going to evolve into a trading range soon and they're more eager to sell. So
the height of this breakout is two ticks and the height of that breakout is
only one tick. It's also three pushes up. One, two, three. So wedge top. When
you see a shrinking stairs pattern, you have to be thinking that the bull
channel is probably ending and that the market will soon evolve into a trading
range. Once it falls below a major higher low, then the pattern of higher lows
is no longer still intact. And if the market's not making higher lows, it's no
longer in a bull trend. It's either in a bear trend or a trading range. This
sell off is not particularly strong. It does not have consecutive big bear
trend bars and is finding support at that major higher low. This looks more
like a bare leg and what will become a trading range. In any case, it's no
longer a bull trend. Here are shrinking bear stairs. That's the size of that
breakout. The next breakout is smaller before the bulls come in. Next breakout,
smaller. Next breakout smaller. Well, the bears are taking profits faster and
the bulls are more eager. 17 pip breakout. Before we get a pullback over here,
the market only fell 6 piss below the breakout point before we got the pullback
and then we ended up with a double bottom. Higher low. Major trend reversal.
Head and shoulders, bottom, left shoulder and right shoulder. The loss of
momentum, the loss of strength on the part of the Bears means that the bear
trend probably is ending and the market will probably enter a trading range or
possibly a bull trend. And once you break above a major lower high like this, a
strong bear breakout for new low. So this lower high is major. Once you break
above it, the market is no longer in a bear trend. It's then either in a
trading range or in a full trend. And at this point you can say, wow, that's a
bull trend. Well, not necessarily. We're still below the top of the bear trend.
And this might simply be a bull, like in a trading range. In any case, it's no
longer a bear. Here's a daily chart of the Euro versus the dollar. Again, a
trend continues as long as it's making major higher lows. We have a series of
higher lows and higher highs. So we're in a bull trend, but we're getting very
deep pullbacks. And some of the pullbacks are strong enough so that traders
would conclude that the market is always, in short, no longer always in long,
yet we're still forming higher lows and higher highs. So even though there are
times when the reversals down are enough to make traders believe we're always
in short, the big picture is we're still in a bull trend. We have bull channel
with very deep pullbacks, strong their pullbacks, but we're continuing to form
new higher lows. It's a broad bull channel. The bulls are looking for pullbacks
to the middle third or so of the prior bull leg. And they'll look to buy in the
middle third or they'll buy a reversal up here, a bull trendable leg. Here's a
pullback into that middle third. Also looking to buy here, another leg up. This
is the middle of that leg up. The bulls are looking to buy somewhere in the
middle of that last leg up. Higher probability of profit if traders are buying
above a bull bar or after a second leg down. So one pullback, two micro double
bottom, small bull bar, higher probability buying above that. Two legs down,
one pullback, two does not really look like two legs, but it is two small legs
and then one pullback, two. Maybe this is already two legs double bottom. So it
might be one and then new high. But part of the correction from this side and
two legs down. But anyway, it's a double bottom in the middle third.
Traditional buy reversal up micro double bottom. They'll buy in reverse 1.
Which bull flag? They'll buy a reversal up. We're still in the middle third.
They'll buy a reversal up and bulls are taking profits at new highs. You know
that because the market is going down, market makes a new high and it goes
down. That means traders are selling, bulls are selling to take profits, bears
are selling to go short. Even though the breakout here was strong, look what
happened. The pullback eventually fell below the top of the breakout. And
that's telling us that it's okay to start selling at new highs. Using wide stops
and scaling in bear sell. New highs for scalps here, they probably would sell
more here and get out break even on their first entry with profit on the second
entry. Here it immediately went down. So they simply scalp out somewhere in the
middle third of the last full leg. Here a bear would sell, keeps going up, sell
more and then try to get out break even on their first entry and then with a
profit on their second entry. If they sell at the prior high and it immediately
goes down, they simply take their profits somewhere in the middle third of the
most recent bull life. Same here. They sold did not go up high enough for them
to scale in, but it did pull back into the middle third of the most recent bull
leg and they took profits. In this video I talked about three types of trends.
The trend from the open trend, a trend that begins on the first bar or second
or third bar of a session. And next talk about trending trading range days
where early in the session there's a trading range. But the trading range is
only about half of the height of a typical daily range. So traders expect the
range to double. And finally I talked about broad channels, for example, a
broad bull channel as deep pullbacks. And sometimes the sell offs are so strong
the market is always in short, at least for a little bit, yet it reverses up
from a higher low. So the series of higher highs and higher lows continues and
therefore the market is in a bull channel, which is a type of bull trend. I'm

<p class=MsoNormal>Training course this is the.&nbsp;This is Al
Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you for watching the Brooks training course.&nbsp;This is
the fifth of five videos on trends.&nbsp;In this video I'm going to be talking
about tight channels which are strong trends.&nbsp;And I'll also talk about
small pullback trends which are the strongest types of trends.&nbsp;Sometimes
you see a trend like this, we got a spike up and then a channel and it's
difficult to know if this is still part of the breakout phase or if it's part
of a channel on a higher time frame chart.&nbsp;It is part of the
breakout.&nbsp;And if it's difficult to tell whether it's a breakout or a tight
channel, assume it's a breakout and trade it like a breakout and only look to
buy because it is the breakout on a higher time frame chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>00:58</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's clearly a bull trend.&nbsp;So you should only
buy.&nbsp;Can you sell?&nbsp;I would only buy whenever the market is in a
fairly typical channel.&nbsp;It's a breakout on a higher time frame
chart.&nbsp;It's much easier to make money looking to buy.&nbsp;The odds of
making money as a bear are small, so better only if you look to buy.&nbsp;So
let's say this is a five minute surprises me.&nbsp;A tight channel is weak
compared to a breakout, but it's still a pretty strong bull trend.&nbsp;The
pullback only lasted one bar.&nbsp;Pullback only lasted one bar here, no
pullback at all.&nbsp;Even if you do get a reversal, it's probably minor and
you're probably going to get at least a little bit more up.&nbsp;So I think of
a tight channel as a strong trend and I trade it like a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>01:54</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I said on a higher time frame chart, it is a
breakup.&nbsp;So for example, five minute chart.&nbsp;This green box here, this
green box is the same bars but this is a 15 minute chart and it's clearly
simply a strong breakout.&nbsp;And you don't want to be selling so you only
want to be trading in the direction of the breakout type bear channel.&nbsp;The
pullbacks are small, they're not going very far up and the channel down is very
tight.&nbsp;It's a breakout on some higher time frame chart.&nbsp;There are
always different ways to draw the channel.&nbsp;This is one way.&nbsp;You can
also draw it that way as well.&nbsp;And it does not matter when the pullbacks
are small.&nbsp;You only want to be looking to sell.&nbsp;And here we got a gap
this low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>02:41</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These highs, the market's forming gaps or you only want to
be selling.&nbsp;And if you want, you can sell with stops on reversals
down.&nbsp;So you wait For a reversal up to fail.&nbsp;And then you keep
looking to sell below the low of the prior bar, betting that the bull reversal
will fail and that the bull reversal in fact will simply be a bear
flag.&nbsp;Here you sell.&nbsp;Does not matter if this goes above that, we're
still forming lower highs, major lower highs.&nbsp;This is a minor lower high.&nbsp;So
it does not matter that we go above it.&nbsp;Traders should only be looking to
sell.&nbsp;When the channel is this tight.&nbsp;It's a breakout on a higher
time frame chart.&nbsp;So you only look to sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>03:22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And these gaps that we're getting are a sign that it's a
very strong trend and you should not be buying.&nbsp;We'll break out a
channel.&nbsp;We have pullbacks, we have some beer bars, but the pullbacks only
last a bar or so and they do not fall very far.&nbsp;And our higher time frame
chart is a breakout.&nbsp;Many ways to draw the channel, this is one
way.&nbsp;And you can also draw it like that.&nbsp;And the channels, they're
never perfect.&nbsp;They're rarely perfect.&nbsp;Doesn't matter when the channel
is very tight like this.&nbsp;Only look to buy.&nbsp;Every time you see a
reversal attempt expected to fail become a bull flag and then buy for the
stop.&nbsp;Above the high of the prior bar gaps, we have a reversal
attempt.&nbsp;But the low of the reversal did not fall above the high of the
breakout point.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>04:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again here, bull breakout tried to fail.&nbsp;Try to reverse
here.&nbsp;But these bars held above the breakout point.&nbsp;And that is a
sign of a very strong bull trend.&nbsp;So you do not want to sell.&nbsp;This is
unlike a broad channel where the pullbacks last five, ten bars or
more.&nbsp;And sometimes the breakout is strong enough to make the
market.&nbsp;Always in short.&nbsp;So we got a big breakout bar and a follow
through bar.&nbsp;Probably always in short, but we're still getting higher
lows.&nbsp;And this still could be a broad bull channel.&nbsp;A broad channel
like this to me is basically a trading range that sloped upward.&nbsp;And you
can trade both as a bull and as a bear.&nbsp;But because it's a bull trend in
general, it's easier to make money buying.&nbsp;It's also a pair of trading
agents.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>05:09</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We had a trading range and then a breakout and another
trading range.&nbsp;And that's often the case.&nbsp;That's usually the
case.&nbsp;Whenever the market's in a broad channel, it's usually also spending
a lot of time in trading ranges.&nbsp;Trading range, two sided
trading.&nbsp;Traders tend to buy low, sell high and scalp.&nbsp;So whenever
the market is either a trading range or a broad channel, traders will often
trade in both Directions and they'll take quick profits because they believe
the market's not going to go very far.&nbsp;So they buy low, sell high and
scalp.&nbsp;So whenever the market falls somewhere in the middle third, they
look goodbye.&nbsp;Anytime it goes to a new high, they look to sell and they
take quick profits because they believe the market's not going to go very
far.&nbsp;So you got a bull channel, is it tight or broad?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>06:03</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, sometimes you're in that gray zone where you don't
really know.&nbsp;Here we got a two bar pullback, little one bar pull back
here, two bar pullback here.&nbsp;You know a little trading range here.&nbsp;Is
it a tight channel or is it a breakout on a higher time frame?&nbsp;Chart is
probably a breakout.&nbsp;But whenever I'm looking at any chart and I'm
deciding broad or tight channel, I always assume tight and therefore I only
want to look to buy until there's more evidence that the market is two sided.&nbsp;If
you cannot tell broad or tight, only look goodbye like in this example.&nbsp;So
every time the market tries to reverse and pause look to buy with the stock as
the market reverses up.&nbsp;Small pullback trend, the strongest type of
trend.&nbsp;And it usually is also some other type of trend as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>06:59</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like a trend from the open, the spike in channel
trend.&nbsp;A lot of times there are small trading ranges so it's a trending
trading range day.&nbsp;And the pullbacks, I said it's a small pullback
trend.&nbsp;So the pullbacks are small, they typically do not fall very far and
they typically do not last many bars.&nbsp;So one bar here, one or two bars
here.&nbsp;We're getting reversal attempts and a lot of the rally and a small
pull like bull trend looks like a bull leg in a trading range.&nbsp;You're not
getting consecutive big trend bars.&nbsp;You're getting bars with a lot of
hesitation tails on top air bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>07:34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that is a warning that either a bull leg in a trading
range or if you're starting to get gaps or negative gaps, pullbacks just
dipping a little bit below breakout points or not dipping below at
all.&nbsp;Even though it looks like a bull leg in a trading range, it's
probably a small pullback bull trend, it is probably going a lot
higher.&nbsp;So pullbacks just lasting a few bars, no consecutive big bear
bars.&nbsp;The pullbacks are all less than half the size of an average
bar.&nbsp;A small pullback bull trend is a trend where the pullbacks are small
and they're usually brief.&nbsp;They can last one bar, sometimes they can last
two or three bars.&nbsp;When they do, they're still not Very deep pullbacks are
small.&nbsp;It often begins in the first hour, but it can begin at any point
during the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>08:31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pullbacks are usually less than half the size of an
average bar.&nbsp;The biggest pullback lasts only a couple bars.&nbsp;Here we
have a pullback lasting a couple of bars.&nbsp;It didn't even fall below the
low of the prior bar.&nbsp;Here we have a pullback that went one bar
down.&nbsp;Another one went one bar down and not very deep.&nbsp;The pullbacks
are less than half the size of an average bar.&nbsp;Typically.&nbsp;This is an
important feature when you have a small pullback bull trend.&nbsp;One of the
ways to be sure that it's unfolding is the presence of gaps.&nbsp;For example,
we have a breakout and this pullback stayed above the high of this
bar.&nbsp;And it also stayed above the high of this bar.&nbsp;So there is a gap
there.&nbsp;And the bull trend resumed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>09:27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The low of this bar, we pull back sideways for a couple of
bars.&nbsp;The low of both of these bars stayed above the high of this
bar.&nbsp;A gap.&nbsp;This tail overlapped the high of this bar, but the bodies
did not overlap.&nbsp;Therefore it's a body gap.&nbsp;I used to call those
negative gaps.&nbsp;And it's still a sign of strength.&nbsp;In small pullback
trends, you typically see mostly body gaps, but you usually see at least one
actual gap.&nbsp;Body gap means that there's a gap between the lows of the
bodies of the pullback bar and the highs of the bodies of the breakout point
bars.&nbsp;So the highs of these bars, the lows of these bars, and that is a
sign of strength here.&nbsp;This bar pulled back below the bar, overlapped the
breakout point slightly, but the bodies did not overlap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10:24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this body in fact did not even overlap the tail of that
bar.&nbsp;That's a sign of a strong bull trend.&nbsp;And these trends are
breakouts on higher time frame charts.&nbsp;So here's a five minute chart,
small pullback, bear trim.&nbsp;And this is what it looks like on a 30 minute
chart.&nbsp;Higher time frame chart, Almost all bear bars, mostly a bear micro
channel.&nbsp;So it's a bear breakout.&nbsp;Each of these pullbacks means that
it's a channel on the five minute chart.&nbsp;But the absence of pullbacks on
the 30 minute chart means that it's a breakout foreign because this channel is
a breakout on a higher time frame chart.&nbsp;The five minute chart is much
stronger than it appears.&nbsp;A breakout is the strongest type of trend and it
usually leads to some kind of a measured move.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11:25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have a small pullback bear trend, you know it's a
breakout on the higher Time frame charts.&nbsp;And you know, it's therefore one
of the strongest types of trends, even though most of the time it keeps looking
like it's a bare leg in a trading range.&nbsp;These gaps that I talked about
are really important.&nbsp;This is a very strong bear trend and I want to make
some points about gaps.&nbsp;The gaps are staying open.&nbsp;That is a sign of
a strong trend.&nbsp;Here you see no overlap between the pullback and the
breakout point.&nbsp;No overlap, pullback and the breakout point.&nbsp;That's a
sign of a very strong bear trend.&nbsp;Traders who are buying at the low here,
betting that they'll be able to make money buying at the low and scaling and
lower, are getting trapped.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They needed this pullback to get above that breakout point
and it did not.&nbsp;And those bulls bought had to sell here for loss.&nbsp;And
that's one of the problems with gaps.&nbsp;The limit order bulls betting that
this is a bare leg in a trading range are losing money and they have to give
up.&nbsp;And it helps drive the trend down lower.&nbsp;In general, a trader
should not be buying in a bear trend until he sees limit order bulls making
money.&nbsp;In other words, he wants to see pullbacks going above breakout
points.&nbsp;For example, here, this pullback went above this breakout
point.&nbsp;Therefore, traders who bought at this low and bought more lower
could make money.&nbsp;Or traders who did not buy at the low and they simply
bought more lower could make money.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13:11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's usually the first sign that the channel is weakening
and the market might soon enter a trading age.&nbsp;Traders should not be
buying until they're seeing some overlap.&nbsp;And even then it's still better
to only sell.&nbsp;I wanted to make a point here.&nbsp;You can see we have
overlap.&nbsp;The pullback is going above the breakout point.&nbsp;But there's
something very important to notice about this pullback as well, and that's
this.&nbsp;Look at the bodies here, the low of the bodies here, and look at the
highs of the bodies here.&nbsp;The tails are overlapping, but the bodies are
not.&nbsp;And I call that a body gap.&nbsp;And it's still a sign that the bears
are pretty strong.&nbsp;Most traders should not be looking to buy when there
are still body gaps in these very tight bull channels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14:07</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Small pullback trends the market's always trying to reverse,
but the breakouts will fail, become both likes and usually later in the day,
after three, four, five hours of trading.&nbsp;If you're trading stock index
futures a lot of times around 11:00, 10:00, sometimes 12:00, but usually around
11:00, 11:30, you get a breakout that is 50 to 100 bigger than the biggest
prior breakout.&nbsp;So here's the biggest prior breakout.&nbsp;And then here
we got one that's about 50 bigger.&nbsp;And it's an attempt by the bears to
take control and reverse the market late in the day.&nbsp;But chances are the
beers will fail and the reversal attempt will become a bull flag.&nbsp;And a
lot of times it goes up to a new high.&nbsp;At the end of the day, we have a
very strong breakout, another breakout, and then a very small pullback bull
trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15:05</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You hold a tight channel, sometimes you get a bigger
reversal late in the day.&nbsp;This is extremely climactic.&nbsp;It's not a
surprise.&nbsp;And sometimes you get a sell off into the end of the session or
to the close of the day.&nbsp;You know, here we're sideways for 20 to 30
bars.&nbsp;Now we got a double top major trend reversal.&nbsp;We just sold off
slightly to into the close.&nbsp;Sometimes you'll get these small pullback
trends and they actually will reverse.&nbsp;Here we got a spike in channel,
maybe a parabolic wedge.&nbsp;1, 2, 3, nested 1, 2, 3.&nbsp;And then you start
to get an endless pullback in that tight channel like that.&nbsp;You got to be
thinking that the market might be seeing this as a parabolic wedge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15:53</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if it does, a lot of times you'll get a breakout after
20 or 30 bars and then you convert into a bear trend.&nbsp;We got a bear
breakout bear follow through.&nbsp;You can say, well, Al, these are gap
bars.&nbsp;There's a gap between the high of the bar and the moving
average.&nbsp;Won't that lead to a test of the bull trend high and then a major
trend reversal attempt?&nbsp;Well, it typically does, except that this endless
pullback and our tight bear channel has gone on for 20 or more bars and it's making
the market pretty neutral.&nbsp;So this bull reversal may not get very
far.&nbsp;You can see the bad follow through in the market failing to break
strongly above the moving average.&nbsp;Is it now a small pullback bear
trend?&nbsp;Usually I don't think of it that way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16:46</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I think of a small pullback bull trend and then an
endless bear pullback.&nbsp;But to me, this is a real problem for the
bulls.&nbsp;This is so climactic, unsustainable.&nbsp;And now we have an
endless pullback and a beer breakout and a reversal up could not get above the
top of the bear breakout.&nbsp;This might be the start of a bear trend, this
beer breakout bar.&nbsp;So you got to be ready if the market starts to sell
off.&nbsp;Especially once you get another bear bar and a beer follow through bar
traders start to sell Closes and they sell above bull bars.&nbsp;Betting the
reversal up will fail.&nbsp;Usually if you have a small pullback bull trend,
you do not get a reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17:29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is really more of a spike and channel bull trend or
parabolic wedge bull trend and less of a small pullback bull trend.&nbsp;I
typically don't call this a small pullback bull trend, although it clearly is
to me.&nbsp;It's just so climatic and so extreme.&nbsp;I think of it more as a
buy climax.&nbsp;Remember I said that small pullback bull trends, typically
they have weak bars, a lot of doji bars, primitive tails, bear bars.&nbsp;Looks
like a bow leg in a trading range.&nbsp;That's not the case here.&nbsp;This is
much more of a parabolic bicycle max parabolic wedge, biclimax.&nbsp;This is
more of a small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;Got a lot of bars with
tails.&nbsp;We've got some gaps.&nbsp;Does not look especially strong.&nbsp;No
big bear bars.&nbsp;We're getting bad follow through bull bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18:19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But here we got a bull breakout and a higher low.&nbsp;So
it's possible that this is a higher low major trend reversal.&nbsp;And this is
maybe a final bear flag.&nbsp;Look.&nbsp;Short two legs up, one pull back, two
short and wedge bottom and then a higher low major trend reversal.&nbsp;So
possible start of a reversal up which we got less common after a small pullback
bear trend.&nbsp;But you still can get it.&nbsp;Higher low, major trend
reversal.&nbsp;Some will say this is the higher low major trend
reversal.&nbsp;This is a double bottom with this bear bar.&nbsp;Other computers
will say the double bottom is here.&nbsp;So it's a double bottom.&nbsp;Higher
low, major trend reversal.&nbsp;Small pullback trends are also tight
channels.&nbsp;That only makes sense, right?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19:16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the pullbacks are really small and the market's trending
higher, it's going to be in a tight channel.&nbsp;Pullbacks are usually less
than two to three times the size of the smallest scalp.&nbsp;Here we have a
bigger pullback late in the day.&nbsp;Usually it fails to get trend resumption
up and you redraw the channel.&nbsp;So we have a tight channel here.&nbsp;We
broke below it and now the market's resuming up.&nbsp;You redraw the channel
and the distance between the lines is now greater.&nbsp;Channels, as they
mature, transist they mature, typically become weaker and the channels tend to
become broader and flatter.&nbsp;Go flatter.&nbsp;The slope of this new channel
is less than the slope of this original channel.&nbsp;Whatever you think, the
market might be in a fairly strong gold trend.&nbsp;Do not sell.&nbsp;Maybe we
got a bull breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20:14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want to sell or fail breakout?&nbsp;I would
not.&nbsp;Not yet.&nbsp;A lot of beginners like to sell in bull trends because
the stop is close, but they ignore probability.&nbsp;And whenever you're taking
a trade with a low risk, small risk, chances are you're going to lose, the
probability is going to be low.&nbsp;And if you get enough of Those small
losses, 3, 4, 5 small losses, it can add up to a pretty big loss.&nbsp;So
whenever you're in a market where the pullbacks are very small, even if you see
a lot of weak looking bull bars do not sell because on a higher time frame,
it's a full breakout.&nbsp;So the trader sells here, you get stopped
out.&nbsp;Trader sells here, gets stocked up, trader sells here, probably will
get stocked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21:12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of bulls are afraid to buy because the rally looks
weak.&nbsp;Tight training range with dojis, bull bar, bad follow through bull
bars with doji's bull breakout not all that big.&nbsp;So bulls end up getting
trapped out.&nbsp;At least weak bulls do, because they know where their shop
is.&nbsp;The shop is way down here, so they don't want to be buying too far up
in a rally that looks weak.&nbsp;But if the market is forming gaps and not much
in terms of bear bars, it's perfectly good to buy for any reason and just use
the appropriate stop.&nbsp;Beginners, they just look at the dojis and say, oh,
strong bull trends do not have all these dojis so it cannot go higher.&nbsp;In
general, that's true.&nbsp;Breakouts do not have all those small dojis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21:58</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But small pullback bull trends, they do have a lot of small
dojis.&nbsp;And the market is in one of the strongest types of trends you don't
want to be selling.&nbsp;The wider the stop you use on any trade, the higher
the probability is that you make money.&nbsp;When you do lose, you obviously
lose more than with a tight stop.&nbsp;But as a general rule, if you use wide
stops, you're increasing your risk, but you're doing that to increase your
probability.&nbsp;So why stops usually mean higher probability?&nbsp;Tight
stops usually mean low probability of making money.&nbsp;So you know where the
stop is.&nbsp;Initially it's down here and then you see a bull breakout or
somewhere up here.&nbsp;You raise the stop here.&nbsp;After you see three or
four or five bars up, strong breakout, this becomes a major higher low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22:56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you raise the stop.&nbsp;The strong goals, they see the
doji bars and they see the bare bodies.&nbsp;They know the trend does not look
all that strong, but they also recognize it as a small pullback bull trend
day.&nbsp;They see gaps and negative gaps with a lot of trading range, price
action.&nbsp;And that usually means the market is Going to go higher, small by
bull trend.&nbsp;And they buy for any reason.&nbsp;You can buy reversals up
from bear tops, you can buy stop orders, you can buy at the market.&nbsp;And
then every time you get a reasonably strong breakout, especially with follow
through, you tighten your stop to just below the breakout or just below the
most recent higher level strong breakout.&nbsp;Move the shot from here to
there.&nbsp;Bulls buying above these bars, betting on a bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23:51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you get this breakout, you raise the stop and this
becomes a major higher low.&nbsp;Major because it has both decent bull bars and
it's a new high.&nbsp;One other thought about this is the best looking bull
bar.&nbsp;Probably we got one comparable here, but certainly one of the best
one or two bull bars.&nbsp;And it's occurring late in a bull trend.&nbsp;So
that's an increased risk of exhaustion.&nbsp;Exhausted bulls do not necessarily
sell enough to create a short a bear trend.&nbsp;Usually they do
not.&nbsp;However, they usually do sell enough to create a training
range.&nbsp;So if you start to see a surprise bar like this late in the bull
trend, 30, 40, 50 bars, it's an opportunity to take profits.&nbsp;Sometimes
when you get these small pullback bull trends, they stay above the average price
for a lot of bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24:55</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is maybe 30, 40 bars above the moving
average.&nbsp;That means bulls are really aggressive.&nbsp;They're willing and
eager to pay above an average price for 20 or 30 bars.&nbsp;So what do you
think will happen when it finally gets down to an average price?&nbsp;Well, the
bulls will buy.&nbsp;They've been buying above an average price for a lot of
bars.&nbsp;So if they finally get a chance to buy at the moving average, they
usually take it bars or more than 20 bars.&nbsp;I think of it as a 20 Gap bar
buy setup.&nbsp;And a lot of bulls will place limit orders to buy the moving
average, at least for a scalp.&nbsp;Also, a lot of bulls will look for the
first bear close below the moving average and they'll buy that bear
close.&nbsp;Betting that is a trap and it usually is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25:51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So here you have a 20 gap or buy.&nbsp;You can buy the
moving average replacement limit order to buy one take above.&nbsp;Or you can
buy these gap bars betting that the trend is so strong you will zoom up to a
new high.&nbsp;Bulls, as I said, try to buy the first bear thing.&nbsp;So the
first time there's a pullback below the low of the par bar, they buy
it.&nbsp;First time there's a break below a minor higher low, they buy it
first.&nbsp;Test of the moving average, they buy it first bear close below the
moving average, they buy it first.&nbsp;Big bear trend bar Below the moving
average, they buy it.&nbsp;Gap bars.&nbsp;As soon as they see bars with a gap
between the high and bar and the moving average, they buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26:37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They can either buy the gap bar or they can buy the reversal
back up using a stop.&nbsp;And here we have a moving average gap bar gap
between the high of the bar and the moving average.&nbsp;So bulls will buy on a
stop just above the high of that bar.&nbsp;And even though we're getting a lot
of sell offs here, we're still making higher lows and higher high gap
bars.&nbsp;It's a sign that the bulls are losing control and it's a sign of
strong bears.&nbsp;They're able to put a bar completely below the moving
average.&nbsp;So when you get gap bars, you know, bull trend that's going on
for two or three hours.&nbsp;The rally that follows the gap bars usually will
be the final rally before the market attempts a major trend reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27:32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E mini trends from the open bull trend, very strong bull
breakout, pullback and moving up again.&nbsp;When it's this strongly up, I tend
to think of it more as just a breakout and an extended breakout on a higher
time frame chart.&nbsp;I also am aware of the possibility that it could be a
parabolic wedge top small pullback bull trend.&nbsp;Also a trend from the open
bull trend and spike and channel bull trends.&nbsp;Spike pullback channel or
the whole thing is a spike pullback channel.&nbsp;Again, most trends have a
spike and channel trend within them.&nbsp;First pullback in about 15 bars or
so.&nbsp;First pullback in about 15 bars or so.&nbsp;Those will buy it and pull
back.&nbsp;You're going to be thinking that channel will follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28:30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here we got a 14 tick pullback and the first pullback to
the moving average at about 50 bars.&nbsp;Small pullback.&nbsp;Old trends, you
always look for a bigger pullback later in the day.&nbsp;Usually about 50 to
100% bigger.&nbsp;Here we got a 14 tick pullback.&nbsp;And here we have a 31
tick pullback.&nbsp;A lot of bars that do not look particularly bullish.&nbsp;A
lot of small bars, a lot of dojis, a lot of prominent tails, A lack of
consecutive big bull bars closing on their highs.&nbsp;One of the
characteristics of a small pullback bull trend.&nbsp;And then most importantly,
in addition to seeing weak bars, I want to see gaps at least one or two.&nbsp;A
pullback held above breakout point.&nbsp;And again here that's a sign of very
strong bulls.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29:32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it increases the chances that we'll get some kind of a
measured move up.&nbsp;In fact, here, measured move from the bottom of the bull
trend to the top of this Rally takes us up to about the high of the
day.&nbsp;So from the low of the day to this breakout point measure move
up.&nbsp;This is the US dollar versus the Canadian dollar.&nbsp;And this is the
approximate start of the Asian session and began as a small pullback bull
trend.&nbsp;A lot of weak looking bars, Doji's here, not particularly big bull
bars here, a lot of reversal attempts but it's still a small pullback full
trend.&nbsp;A lot of Doji's common in small pullback bull trends.&nbsp;Look at
the size of the pullbacks.&nbsp;13 pips, 17 pips, 22 pips.&nbsp;They're all
pretty small.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30:30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Entire rally went up 115 points and the biggest pullback was
only 22 pips.&nbsp;So very small pullback in the bull trend.&nbsp;A lot of
dois, a lot of prominent tails.&nbsp;The absence of consecutive big strong bear
trend bars, you have to be thinking about small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;Next
you look to see if there are gaps and if there are gaps the days probably a
fairly strongly bearish day.&nbsp;I always take measure the size of the
pullbacks.&nbsp;So 17 pip pullback here, 19 pips here, 14 here and here we fall
140 points and the biggest pullback was only 19 pips over here.&nbsp;Again lots
of dooks like probably a bare leg in a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31:25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you start to see gaps you gotta throw out that idea of
a bare leg in the trading range and instead you have to assume small pullback
bear trend and that we're going to work lower.&nbsp;One of the hallmarks of a
small pullback trend is gap formation.&nbsp;So if you start to see gaps yet the
bars do not look particularly strong, you have to assume that the market is
much stronger than what you think.&nbsp;Again you can see we have a gap became
measuring gap and a lot of the bulls get out here.&nbsp;You know the market
continues sideways for a couple of hours.&nbsp;In this video I talk about tight
channels and how they are breakouts on higher time frame charts.&nbsp;You only
want to be buying and tight bull channels, you only want to be selling in type
beer channels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32:21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next I talk about small pullback trends which are typically
one of the strongest types of trends and they can last a long time.&nbsp;They
always look bad.&nbsp;They always look like they're forming legs within trading
ranges.&nbsp;But once you start to see gaps, even if the gaps are not
particularly impressive, you have to assume that it's a small pullback trend
and not a leg within our trading range.&nbsp;You I'm Al Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you
