<i>“fireflies.ai transcribed this meeting but I'm wondering if you can ferret
out a price action trading strategy for a day trader in the style of al brooks'
methodology from the following”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Grok's
Strategy:&nbsp;</span></u></b><br>
From the transcription of the meeting, here are the key elements of a price
action trading strategy in the style of Al Brooks for day trading:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trend from the Open:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Identification</b>: A trend from the open begins with
     the first few bars of the session, particularly if there's a gap up or
     down followed by strong directional bars. For example, if the market gaps
     up and the first few bars are bullish, this suggests a bull trend from the
     open.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Strategy</b>: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Long Positions</b>: If there's a gap up followed by
      bullish bars, consider going long, especially if the bars show urgency
      (e.g., closing near their highs). </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Measured Moves</b>: Calculate potential targets based
      on the height of the initial breakout bars. For instance, if the market
      moves up significantly from the open, measure from the open to the high
      of the breakout to estimate where the trend might reach.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Urgency and Momentum</b>: Look for signs of urgency
      like consecutive bull bars without pullbacks, indicating strong buying
      interest.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trending Trading Ranges:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Identification</b>: When the market forms a trading
     range early in the session that's about half the average daily range,
     anticipate that the range will expand.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Strategy</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Trades</b>: Prepare for breakouts from these
      ranges. If the range breaks out upwards, consider long entries; if
      downwards, consider short entries. However, be aware these breakouts
      might be brief before entering another range.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Overlap Expectations</b>: There's a 60% chance that
      the new range will overlap with the previous range, suggesting potential
      for counter-trend moves.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability of Direction</b>: After about 20 bars in a
      range, the probability of a breakout in either direction is roughly
      50/50.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broad Channels:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Identification</b>: These are trends characterized by
     deep pullbacks within a broader channel, forming a &quot;stairs
     pattern&quot; where pullbacks often exceed previous breakout points.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Strategy</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Scalping</b>: In these scenarios, trading within the
      channel involves buying at the lower third and selling/scalping in the
      middle third, expecting the market to continue within the channel before
      any significant breakout.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Swing Trading</b>: In bear channels, while scalping is
      common, some might hold for swings if they believe in the ongoing trend
      direction, but with caution due to potential range expansion.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reversal Signals</b>: Watch for shrinking stair
      patterns or significant breaks below major higher lows or above major
      lower highs as signs of potential trend exhaustion or reversal.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>General Principles:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Context Over Patterns</b>: Always consider the context
     of the market (trend, trading range, channel) before deciding on a trade.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Use of Stops</b>: Place stops logically based on recent
     price action, like just below/above breakout points or swing highs/lows.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Taking</b>: In trends, take profits around
     measured moves or at significant resistance/support levels; in ranges,
     scalp within the range.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>This strategy emphasizes reading the market's immediate
price action, understanding the context, and adapting strategies based on
whether the market is trending, ranging, or channeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk185533152"><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
line-height:107%'>Exit Plan:&nbsp;</span></u></b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>in the context of this video, in as many words as you
think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader EXITS a
position</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
In the context of the video, Al Brooks provides several nuanced recommendations
on how traders should exit positions, tailored to different market conditions
and trading strategies. Here's a detailed breakdown:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>General Exit Principles:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exit Based on Market Context</b>: Brooks emphasizes
     that the exit strategy should align with the market's current state
     (trend, range, or channel). This context dictates whether you should be
     looking for a scalp, a swing, or a more extended hold.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Using Stops</b>: Stops are not just for limiting losses
     but also for protecting profits. Brooks often advocates for placing stops
     at logical price levels, like below the most recent major higher low in a
     bull trend or above the most recent major lower high in a bear trend.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Targets</b>: Brooks discusses setting profit
     targets based on measured moves or the structure of the market pattern,
     particularly after a breakout or within trending trading ranges.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting in Specific Market Conditions:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend from the Open:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quick Exits for Scalps</b>: If trading for a scalp,
      Brooks suggests exiting quickly if the market does not behave as
      expected. &quot;If I think that a pullback is acceptable, a lot of times
      I’ll scale in during a pullback. But if I’m looking at a pullback and I’m
      saying, 'Wait a minute, it should not be doing that,' then I get
      out.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Allowing Pullbacks for Swings</b>: For swing trades,
      he advises allowing for pullbacks as part of the trend continuation, but
      ensures the premise of the trade remains valid, &quot;As long as your
      premise is valid and as long as the market — in this case, a bull trend —
      as long as every pullback stays above the most recent breakout low.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trending Trading Ranges:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting on Breakout Failures</b>: Traders should be
      ready to exit if a breakout does not sustain, especially given the high
      failure rate of breakouts within trading ranges. &quot;80% of breakout
      attempts fail within a trading range,&quot; suggests that many traders
      might exit on signs of reversal back into the range.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broad Channels:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Scalping Within Channels</b>: Here, exits are often
      based on reaching the middle third of the channel where resistance or
      support might be encountered. &quot;You buy low, buy in the bottom third
      and you scalp somewhere in the middle.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Swing Trade Exits</b>: For swing trades within
      channels, Brooks might hold longer if the trend continues but exit if the
      market shows signs of trend exhaustion or reversal, like when pullbacks
      start overlapping previous breakout points, suggesting a weakening trend.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exit Tactics:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Scaling Out</b>: For larger positions, Brooks discusses
     the idea of scaling out of trades, where you might exit part of the
     position at one level, perhaps at a measured move, and hold the rest for
     further potential gains or until another exit signal.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trailing Stops</b>: In trends, he suggests using
     trailing stops to lock in profits while giving the trade room to run. This
     involves moving the stop-loss up as the price moves in your favor.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting on Reversal Signals</b>: If a strong reversal
     bar or pattern forms that contradicts the current trend or range, Brooks
     advises considering an exit, even if it means taking a smaller profit or a
     break-even.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting at Psychological Levels</b>: He notes that
     markets often react to round numbers or significant highs/lows, suggesting
     these can be good exit points, especially if they align with other
     technical indicators or price action signals.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Urgency and Momentum</b>: If the market shows urgency
     in the opposite direction of your position, Brooks recommends exiting to
     avoid being caught in a sudden reversal or trend change.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Aspect:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks stresses the importance of not being too attached
     to a trade. If the market doesn't move as anticipated or if there's a
     clear sign of trend change, the discipline to exit is crucial.
     &quot;Beginners often focus too much on risk... They're always looking for
     the tightest possible stop,&quot; which can also apply to profit-taking,
     where traders might exit too early or too late due to fear or greed.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, Brooks' exit strategies are adaptive,
emphasizing the importance of market context, the use of stops and targets, and
the psychological discipline to act on price action clues. His approach
combines tactical exits based on immediate market behavior with strategic exits
that consider broader market trends and probabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Grok's
350 word Executive Summary of the Video</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Now give me your executive summary of the video in 350
words”<a name="_Hlk185424610"></a></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
In this video, Al Brooks explores three types of trends critical for day
traders:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend from the Open</b>: This trend starts with the
     session's first few bars, often marked by a gap up or down followed by
     strong directional bars. For instance, a gap up with consecutive bullish
     bars signals a potential bull trend. Traders should look for urgency in
     price movements, like bars closing near highs, which could lead to
     significant &quot;measured moves&quot; based on the initial breakout's
     size. The strategy involves taking long positions if the trend continues
     without significant pullbacks.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trending Trading Ranges</b>: Here, the session begins
     with a trading range about half the average daily range, suggesting the
     range might double by day's end. Traders should watch for breakouts from
     this range, which are typically brief before entering another range.
     There's a 60% likelihood that any new range will overlap with the previous
     one, indicating possible counter-trend trades. After around 20 bars, the
     probability of a breakout in either direction becomes nearly 50/50.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broad Channels</b>: Characterized by deep pullbacks
     within a trend, forming a &quot;stairs pattern&quot;. In such channels,
     the market might not be clearly trending or ranging, leading to strategies
     like buying low and selling/scalping in the middle third of the channel. This
     approach often involves scalping due to uncertainty about the trend's
     continuation or reversal. Significant signs include shrinking stair steps,
     suggesting the channel might evolve into a trading range or reverse.</li>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks emphasizes understanding the market's current
context, whether it's trending, ranging, or channeling, to adapt trading
strategies accordingly. He highlights the importance of recognizing trend
strength or exhaustion through price action, like urgency in moves, the size of
breakouts, and the behavior of pullbacks relative to previous highs and lows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks
Speaks:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Look through the transcript at the references to the
specific examples Brooks makes, and talk about what he talks about, how it
relates to the context of the whole video, using specific quotations from
Brooks to make your points, both specific to his point or in a broader
context.&quot;</i><br>
<br>
Here's an analysis of specific examples Al Brooks provides in the transcript,
their relevance to the video's context, and how they illustrate both immediate
points and broader themes, using his direct quotations:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. Trend from the Open:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;When you have a trend from the open
like this, the more bars that get added to it, the more likely this ends up as
the low of the day.&quot;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Point</b>: Brooks uses this example to teach
     traders how to identify a trend right from the market's open. The addition
     of bars without significant pullbacks indicates trend strength, guiding
     traders to anticipate the day's range or trend direction early on.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context</b>: This example is foundational to
     Brooks' methodology, emphasizing the importance of the open in setting the
     day's trading bias. It relates to his overarching theme of how initial
     market moves can dictate strategy, &quot;When you get that on the open like
     this, the odds are 60% or greater. You're going to get some kind of a
     measured move up.&quot; This ties into understanding market momentum and
     urgency, key for trend following or range trading decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Trending Trading Ranges:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;When I see a trading range like this
on the open of the market and the trading range is about half of the height of
an average day's range, I'm assuming that today's range will be like an average
day's range and that the range will double.&quot;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Point</b>: Here, Brooks is demonstrating how
     to predict market behavior based on the initial range's size. It's a
     lesson in anticipating breakouts or range expansions, preparing traders
     for potential trading opportunities.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context</b>: This example fits into the broader
     narrative on market phases where Brooks explains how traders should adapt
     strategies as markets move from one phase to another. It underscores the
     need for traders to be ready for both breakout and range trading scenarios,
     &quot;Once you have a trading range, you got to be thinking breakout
     mode,&quot; illustrating the dynamic nature of markets and the necessity
     of strategic flexibility.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Broad Channels:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;We're in a bear trend and we have
deep pullbacks, but in general still forming lower highs and lower lows. It's a
stairs pattern.&quot;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Point</b>: Brooks uses this example to discuss
     how trends can be complex, with significant counter-trend moves, yet still
     maintain their direction. The &quot;stairs pattern&quot; shows how to
     trade within these conditions, focusing on where to enter trades based on
     pullbacks and breakouts.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context</b>: This example relates to
     understanding market structure and trader psychology. Brooks explains,
     &quot;Bulls who are buying at this low and scaling in lower are making
     money. And that is a sign of a weak trend and a sign that the market will
     probably enter a trading range before too long.&quot; It's an insight into
     how market behavior can signal impending changes in market dynamics, encouraging
     traders to adapt their approaches from trend trading to scalping or range
     trading as conditions evolve.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Additional Points:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Urgency and Momentum</b>: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;When you get a lot of urgency on
      the open like this, very strong breakout lasting about an hour or so,
      market then usually goes sideways for several hours...&quot; This teaches
      traders to capitalize on initial market energy and prepare for subsequent
      consolidation.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability and Statistics</b>: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;60% of the time, when you have a
      trending trading range day like this, the market comes back up at least a
      little bit into the other range.&quot; Brooks uses probabilities to guide
      trading decisions, emphasizing that understanding these odds can refine
      strategy execution.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trader Behavior and Strategy</b>: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;In general, a lot of traders
      simply scalp them because they're not sure whether the trading range will
      continue for a lot more bars.&quot; This reflects on how traders adapt to
      market conditions, choosing between scalping and swing trading based on
      perceived market stability or volatility.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' examples serve dual purposes: they are immediate
lessons in trading based on specific market conditions and part of a larger
educational framework about market dynamics, trader psychology, and strategic
adaptability. Each quote not only illustrates a particular trading technique
but also connects to broader themes of market reading, risk management, and the
psychological aspects of trading, thereby providing a comprehensive guide to
day trading strategy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks
Speaks Specifically:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>what quotation pointers can you find from brooks about
the trading calculation and behaviour from traders? Examples such as &quot;when
the market come to the middle 1/3 of the channel bulls buy again&quot; type
thing</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
From the transcription, here are some specific quotations and pointers from Al
Brooks about trading calculations and trader behavior:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;When you have a trend from the open like this,
     the more bars that get added to it, the more likely this ends up as the
     low of the day.&quot;</b> - This suggests that an early trend can set the
     tone for the day, with the initial direction often defining the day's high
     or low.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;The first bar of the day has a 20% chance of
     being either the high or low of the day.&quot;</b> - This provides a
     statistical perspective on how traders might approach the opening bars of
     a trading session.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;When you get a lot of urgency on the open like
     this, very strong breakout lasting about an hour or so, market then
     usually goes sideways for several hours and then decides between trend
     reversal down and trend resumption up.&quot;</b> - This describes market
     behavior post a strong opening move, highlighting potential trading
     strategies like waiting for consolidation before deciding on trades.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;When you have a trending trading range day like
     this, in this case we have a bear trending trading range day, the market
     comes back up at least a little bit into the other range.&quot;</b> - This
     indicates a trading pattern where traders might expect a pullback into
     previous range areas, offering opportunities for buying or selling.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;60% of the time, when you have a trending trading
     range day like this, the market comes back up at least a little bit into
     the other range.&quot;</b> - This gives a probability for traders to
     consider when planning trades within a trading range context.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Once you get a 20 bar trading range, there's a
     50, 50 chance that you'll get a downside breakout. A trend reversal 50, 50
     chance you'll get an upside breakout trend resumption.&quot;</b> - This
     quantifies the likelihood of breakout directions after an extended trading
     range, guiding traders on potential moves.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Bulls who are buying at this low and scaling in
     lower are making money. And that is a sign of a weak trend and a sign that
     the market will probably enter a trading range before too long.&quot;</b>
     - This reflects on trader behavior in a bear trend, suggesting that buying
     during pullbacks might signal an impending change in market structure.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Bears take profits at the prior lows. So the
     bears who sell here will take at least partial profits at the prior
     low.&quot;</b> - This describes a common profit-taking strategy among
     traders in a bear channel.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Bulls are looking for pullbacks to the middle
     third or so of the prior bull leg. And they'll look to buy in the middle

     to the query, indicating where in a bull channel traders might look to
     enter long positions.</li>

V. Strategy by Brooks in the Context of Video</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I enjoyed what you wrote with what brook says about
trading, in the context of this video. Do you think you could use Brooks'
examples, statements, and quips, to elucidate a contrast of his philosophy
(contrast, list, whatever) between tactics and strategy in regards to the
content of this video?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here's a structured comparison between tactics and strategy as discussed by Al
Brooks in the context of the specific transcript provided, using his examples,
statements, and quips:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend from the Open:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Recognizing a trend immediately after the
      market opens, especially after a gap up or down, to make quick trading
      decisions.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;When you have a trend from the open
      like this, the more bars that get added to it, the more likely this ends
      up as the low of the day.&quot; This tactic involves trading based on the
      urgency and momentum of the first few bars.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Micro Channel Trading:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Trading within short-term micro channels
      that form at the beginning of trends or within larger trends.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Statement</b>: &quot;We had an 11 bar bull micro
      channel. No bear bars, no pullbacks for the first 11 bars.&quot; This
      highlights entering trades based on immediate price action without
      waiting for pullbacks.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout and Pullback:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Capitalizing on breakouts for entry and
      looking for pullbacks for entry or exit points within trends.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight</b>: &quot;They were not even waiting for
      pullbacks. Everyone was so eager to buy that they were buying at the
      market at the close of the bar.&quot; This reflects tactical buying or
      selling based on market urgency.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Range Breakouts:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Entering trades when a breakout from a
      trading range occurs, anticipating the market's next move based on price
      action.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Example</b>: &quot;Once you have a trading
      range, you got to be thinking breakout mode.&quot; Here, the tactic is to
      execute trades based on the breakout's direction, even if brief.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Scalping:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Buying at the lower third and
      selling/scalping in the middle third of a channel, focusing on short-term
      gains within a broader trend.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;You buy low, buy in the bottom
      third and you scalp somewhere in the middle.&quot; This is a tactical
      approach to capitalize on known price movements within channels.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Context Awareness:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Understanding the market's overall
      phase—whether trending, ranging, or channeling—to choose the right
      trading approach.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;When you're not sure whether it's
      still a bear trend, a bear channel or a trading range does not matter.
      You trade it like a trading range.&quot; This strategy involves adapting
      to the market's current state.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Analysis:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Deciding to trade with the trend,
      understanding that trends might continue even with pullbacks or after
      brief consolidations.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Philosophy</b>: &quot;When you get a lot of urgency on
      the open like this, the odds are 60% or greater. You're going to get some
      kind of a measured move up.&quot; This reflects a strategic decision to
      follow through on trends based on probability.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk and Reward Management:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Not just focusing on entry but also on
      where to exit, using market context to set realistic targets or stops.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight</b>: &quot;The more bars that get added to it,
      the more likely this ends up as the low of the day,&quot; suggesting a
      strategy to manage expectations and risk based on trend strength.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability Over Prediction:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Using probabilities like the 60% chance
      of range overlap to guide trading decisions rather than trying to predict
      market movements.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Rule</b>: &quot;60% of the time, when you have
      a trending trading range day like this, the market comes back up at least
      a little bit into the other range.&quot; This teaches traders to use
      statistical likelihoods strategically.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Adaptability and Patience:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Recognizing when to switch from one
      trading style to another, like from trend following to scalping within
      ranges, based on market signals.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;In general, a lot of traders simply
      scalp them because they're not sure whether the trading range will
      continue for a lot more bars.&quot; This shows strategic thinking in
      choosing when to apply different tactics.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Contrast:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics</b> focus on the immediate actions traders take
     in response to market conditions, such as setting entries, exits, and
     managing trades based on short-term price action.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b> guides why these actions are taken,
     focusing on understanding market dynamics, trend persistence, and the
     psychological aspects of trading. Brooks' strategy is about aligning with
     the market's broader movements, using probability and context to inform tactical
     decisions.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, while tactics are about executing trades based
on immediate market signals, Brooks' strategic teachings are about the
overarching plan that dictates when and why to use these tactics, emphasizing
the importance of market phase identification, trend following, and statistical
awareness in trading.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Overview</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The &quot;14 D Trends&quot; educational presentation focused
on key trading concepts, starting with trends from the open, where participants
learned that the first bar of the trading day has a significant influence on
the day's high or low, with a 20% chance of being the extreme and strong buying
pressure indicated by consecutive bull bars. The session then transitioned into
trending trading ranges, highlighting that breakouts are often brief, with a
likelihood of returning to previous ranges after about 20 bars, and that the
market's behavior can shift dramatically between bull and bear phases. Finally,
the discussion covered broad channels characterized by staircase patterns and
the importance of recognizing potential trend reversals when breaking out of
these ranges. The meeting emphasized practical strategies for identifying
trends and configuring trades accordingly, catering specifically to market
dynamics and trader psychology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's a revised comparison incorporating direct quotations
from Al Brooks:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Overlap:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Types of Trends Identified</b>: Both summaries would
     cover the three trends Brooks discusses - &quot;This is the fourth of five
     videos on trends. I'm going to be describing three types of trends in this
     video,&quot; including trends from the open, trending trading ranges, and
     broad channels.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>General Trading Strategies</b>: Both would mention:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Trading strategies around breakouts, particularly in
      trending trading ranges, where Brooks notes, &quot;Once you have a
      trading range, you got to be thinking breakout mode.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>The importance of trends from the open, where Brooks
      says, &quot;When you have a trend from the open like this, the more bars
      that get added to it, the more likely this ends up as the low of the
      day.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Scalping in channels, as Brooks explains, &quot;In
      general, a lot of traders simply scalp them because they're not sure
      whether the trading range will continue for a lot more bars.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Observations by Brooks</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Probabilities like, &quot;60% of the time, when you have
      a trending trading range day like this, the market comes back up at least
      a little bit into the other range.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Trader behavior insights, such as, &quot;Bulls who are
      buying at this low and scaling in lower are making money.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Differences:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Depth of Explanation</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary</b>: I focus on deeper insights like,
      &quot;When you see a shrinking stairs pattern, you have to be thinking
      that the bull channel is probably ending,&quot; providing actionable
      trading advice.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai</b>: Might offer a more superficial
      overview, potentially missing the nuanced advice like Brooks' observation
      on trader urgency, &quot;When you get that on the open like this, the
      odds are 60% or greater. You're going to get some kind of a measured move
      up.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Focus on Calculations and Probabilities</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary</b>: I emphasize specific calculations
      Brooks mentions, like &quot;The first bar of the day has a 20% chance of
      being either the high or low of the day,&quot; which are crucial for
      traders.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai</b>: Could overlook these detailed
      statistical insights unless they are clearly stated, thus not capturing
      the strategic edge Brooks offers.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trader Behavior Insights</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary</b>: I incorporate Brooks' direct advice on
      trader behavior, such as &quot;Bears, they're looking to sell around the
      middle third,&quot; which informs specific trading actions.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai</b>: Might not delve as deeply into these
      behavioral cues, potentially missing the strategic depth Brooks provides.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Emphasis on Market Context</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>My Summary</b>: I stress Brooks' focus on context,
      &quot;When you're not sure whether it's still a bear trend, a bear
      channel or a trading range does not matter. You trade it like a trading
      range,&quot; highlighting the need to adapt strategies based on market
      conditions.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai</b>: Might not emphasize this contextual
      approach as thoroughly, potentially leading to less nuanced trading
      decisions.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Salient Points to Focus On:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Urgency and Momentum</b>: As Brooks states, &quot;When
     you get a lot of urgency on the open like this, very strong breakout
     lasting about an hour or so, market then usually goes sideways for several
     hours,&quot; traders should watch for these signs.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Context</b>: Brooks' quote, &quot;You trade it
     like a trading range,&quot; underscores the need to assess the current
     market condition before deciding on trades.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability and Statistics</b>: Using probabilities
     like &quot;60% chance that the lower range will come back above the bottom
     of the upper range by at least a little bit&quot; for strategic
     decision-making.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trader Psychology and Strategy</b>: Brooks' insights on
     how traders react, &quot;Bulls are looking for pullbacks to the middle
     third or so of the prior bull leg,&quot; guide practical trading
     strategies.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>This revision captures Brooks' direct words to highlight the
key points and differences between the summaries, focusing on what's most
salient for traders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>what would be the most apropos indicator to use for this
video's content when using it to guide day trading decisions?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Moving Averages (MA/SMA/EMA):</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i> “describe to me how the Moving Averages (MA/SMA/EMA) works
and how to use it or interpret it using the al brooks stuff above</i>”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><br>
How Moving Averages (MA/SMA/EMA) Works:</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Moving Averages (MA)</b> are statistical calculations
used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different
subsets of the full data set. Here are the primary types:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Simple Moving Average (SMA)</b>: This is the average of
     a security's price over a specific number of periods. It gives equal
     weight to all prices within the period.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</b>: This type of
     moving average reacts more significantly to recent price changes than the
     SMA. It applies more weight to the most recent price data, making it more
     responsive to new information.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Mechanism:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>SMA</b>: If you were calculating a 10-day SMA, you
     would sum up the closing prices of the last 10 days and then divide by 10.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>EMA</b>: Uses a formula that incorporates a multiplier
     to give more weight to recent prices. The formula for EMA includes a
     smoothing factor, typically calculated as (2 / (time period + 1)).</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Interpreting Moving Averages with Al Brooks' Price
Action:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. Trends from the Open:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>SMA/EMA as Trend Indicators</b>: When Brooks discusses
     a trend from the open, particularly with a gap followed by strong
     directional bars, moving averages can help confirm this trend:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Crossover Signals</b>: A price moving above a
      short-term MA (like a 5 or 10-period EMA) after a gap up can signal the
      continuation of a bullish trend. Conversely, below for bearish trends. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Price Action vs. MA</b>: If the price stays above or
      below the moving average post-open, it confirms the trend Brooks
      describes. If the price pulls back to the MA but doesn't cross it, it
      might suggest strong trend continuation.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Trending Trading Ranges:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Defining Range Boundaries</b>: Brooks talks about
     trading ranges where the initial range might double. Here, moving averages
     can:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Identify Support/Resistance</b>: An SMA or EMA can act
      as dynamic support or resistance within these ranges. When the price
      approaches or touches these averages, it might signal a breakout or a
      bounce back into the range.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>MA Convergence/Divergence</b>: If two MAs (like a 20
      and 50 period) start to converge, it might indicate the range is about to
      squeeze before a breakout, aligning with Brooks' description of brief
      breakouts.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Broad Channels:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Trendlines</b>: Brooks discusses broad channels
     with deep pullbacks:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Direction</b>: An EMA or SMA can help draw the
      channel's trendline by connecting the highs and lows. If the price
      remains above a longer-term MA, it reinforces the channel's direction.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Signals</b>: When the price approaches the
      lower MA within a bull channel, it could be an opportunity for buying as
      per Brooks' strategy of buying in the lower third. Similarly, selling
      near the upper MA in a bear channel.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pullback Confirmation</b>: If the price pulls back to
      a moving average but then rebounds, it confirms the ongoing trend within
      the channel, supporting Brooks' notion of stair-stepping patterns.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Practical Application:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry Points</b>: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Long Entries</b>: When price comes back to a
      supportive MA in a bull trend or breaks above a resistance MA in a
      trending range.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Short Entries</b>: When price touches or breaks below
      a resistance MA in a bear trend or after a failed breakout in a bear
      channel.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exit Points</b>: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Consider exiting when the price crosses below a
      supportive MA in an uptrend or above a resistance MA in a downtrend,
      indicating possible trend exhaustion or reversal.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Confirmation</b>: Use the slope of the MA to
     confirm the trend direction. An upward sloping MA supports a bullish
     trend, and downward for bearish.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoid Noise</b>: Brooks emphasizes context and price
     action; thus, combine MA signals with bar patterns. If the price action
     shows urgency or hesitation at MA levels, it might validate or invalidate
     trading signals.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In essence, moving averages can be a powerful tool when
integrated with Brooks' price action analysis, helping traders visualize
trends, identify potential entry/exit points, and understand market momentum
within the frameworks he describes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane: 00:00 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> This is the fourth of five videos on trends. I'm going to
be describing three types of trends in this video. The first is a trend that
begins on the open. The next I'll talk about trending trading ranges. And
finally I think I'll talk about trends that are broad channels. When I talk
about a trend from the open, I don't necessarily mean a trend from the first
bar of the day, although it often begins with the first bar. In general, the
first bar of the day has a 20% chance of being either the high or low of the
day. When you have a trend from the open like this, the more bars that get
added to it, the more likely this ends up as the low of the day. Here we had a
gap up. I'm not showing much of yesterday. Only two bars we have a gap up and
then the first two bars are bull bars. That alone is enough for me to think of
the day as always in long. That is enough to make me think that the market's in
a bull trend. Even though both bars have tails, one of them has a body that's
at least half as big as the entire bar. Plus it's a pretty good sized body. The
trend continued. Traders were buying all the way up and we had an 11 bar bull
micro channel. No bear bars, no pullbacks for the first 11 bars. They also
started to get consecutive bull bars closing near their highs. And when you get
that on the open like this, the odds are 60% or greater. You're going to get
some kind of a measured move up, for example, based upon maybe the open of the
first bar to the close of the second bar of the breakout and measured move up
takes us to around there. When you see that on the open, a gap up and then one
bar, two bar, three bars, all bull bars. And then you start getting breakout
bars. There's a sense of urgency and that's usually a sign that you're at the
start of what will become a strong bull trend. First 11 bars traders bought at
or above the low of the prior bar. They were not even waiting for pullbacks.
Everyone was so eager to buy that they were buying at the market at the close
of the bar. They were hoping to buy below the low of the prior bar, but the
market for 11 bars did not trade below that prior bars low. When you have a lot
of urgency on the open like this, very strong breakout lasting about an hour or
so, market then usually goes sideways for several hours and then decides
between trend reversal down and trend resumption up. Here the market was in a
trading range for three hours. At the end of the day we got a little trend
resumption up. When you're trading the Forex market, the open is rarely ever
exact. Some days the move, for example in the United States session it might
begin at 5:30, other days might begin at 6:30, other days, 5:00 or 4:45. So
when I'm talking about the trend from the open, I'm usually talking about a
market that has a single session and a clear open like the stock market or the
day session of the E Mini. I usually do not use the phrase trend from the open
when I'm referring to the forest market or any other 24 hour market. These are
open basically 24 hours a day and the sessions overlap and the start of the
sessions is usually not the same. Every day there's often a breakout on a
report around the start of the session and I end up using some other term to
describe the trend. For example here I just simply call it a breakout. We have
a bull breakout and then a channel. For me this is a a bull spike and channel
pattern. And it was also a small pullback bull trend. The pullbacks were very
small. Rather than calling this a trend from the open, I would call it a spike
and channel. The Forex market really only has one clear open a week, but has
three sessions every day. Each of the three sessions can have a trend from the
open of the session, although that open is not necessarily exactly the same
time every day. For example, here for the Euro versus the $5 minute chart, the
start of the session usually corresponds to the start of when financial markets
start to get active. And that is around 5:30 in the morning Pacific time, 8:30
in the morning eastern time. When you get a big move like this, you can call it
a trend from the open bear trend. But since it can begin at different times on
any given day, I would rather simply call it a breakout. Here's again the Euro
versus the dollar and here's the start of the European session Attack trading
range, a pretty unremarkable start. However it became the high of the session.
You have a small bear bar and very bad follow through. There's some hesitation
on the open, some lack of certainty. It could still be a trend from the open
beer trend, even though it's beginning with very quiet two sided trading range
type of price action. If I were to use the phrase trend from the open in this
market, I would call this a trend from the open bear trend. And it's still
trending down from the open even though it's sideways. And then it's starting
to enter a tight bear channel. A much stronger bear trend, a breakout on a
higher time frame chart. We have a nine bar bear micro channel. Five of the
beer bars have big bodies and they close near their lows. And there are three
consecutive strong bear bars here. So this is the beginning of what will
probably result in at least some kind of a measure. Move down maybe based upon
the height of this breakout takes us down here, maybe further. In fact, it did
go further. Do you want to call this a trend from the open beer trend? Here's
the start of the US session. You can, I would simply call it a tight channel
bear trend or a breakout on a higher time frame chart. In any case, it's a
Strong enough trend. 9 Bar Bear micro channel. Several strong bear bars. The
odds are we're going at least a little bit lower. The bears are eager to sell.
They're not waiting for pullbacks. They're selling before there is a pullback.
So they're not trying to sell above the high of the prior bar. They're selling
at the market. They're selling bear closes. They're very eager to sell. And if
everybody's eager to sell, chances are even a small pullback traders will be
eager to sell it. They were willing to sell even without pullbacks. And when
they finally do get a pullback, you know, the odds are high that rather than a
reversal up, it's going to be a bear flag and that will probably go at least a
little bit lower. I now want to talk a little bit about trending trading
ranges. A trend made up of a series of trading ranges. When I see a trading
range like this on the open of the market and the trading range is about half
of the height of an average day's range, I'm assuming that today's range will
be like an average day's range and that the range will double. They can double
pry going up for a measured move. It can double by going down for a measured
move, or it can double by going a little bit down, a little bit up, a little
bit down, a little bit up and remaining a training range day. When a day does
become a trending trading range day, you have an initial range about half of an
average day's range in height and then you have a breakout. And the breakout is
usually fairly brief. Sometimes a single bar, sometimes five bars, sometimes
six or seven bars, but it's brief. And then the market starts to Enter another
trading range. This is a good example of a trending trading range. Today we
have a trading range, a brief breakout for a few bars and then another trading
range 60% of the time. When you have a trending trading range day like this, in
this case we have a bear trending trading range day, the market comes back up
at least a little bit into the other range. A bear trending trading range day.
I'm expecting that the market will at some point come at least a little bit above
the bottom of the upper range 60% of the time that happens. 40% of the time it
does not, and the market either stays sideways or goes down for another. Like
all trading ranges, once you have a trading range, you got to be thinking
breakout mode. And the breakout can go in either direction. Here we have a
trend reversal. So bear trend trading range, bear flag. But instead of a bear
breakout, we're getting a bull breakout in general. Once the trading range
extends for about 20 bars, this one's a little bit less. Once it extends for
about 20 bars, the probability of the bull breakout is just as high. As for the
bear breakout, it's basically a 5050 market. Again, 60% chance that the lower
range will come back above the bottom of the upper range by at least a little
bit. The breakouts when you have a trending trading range today usually last 3,
4, 5 bars, 6 bars and then you start to get signs of another range. You can see
here we have a couple bull bars and then a bear bar. A bull bar and then do.
Looks like at this point we're probably going to enter another range and the
day will be a trending trading each day. Once you get a 20 bar trading range,
there's a 50, 50 chance that you'll get a downside breakout. A trend reversal
50, 50 chance you'll get an upside breakout trend resumption. The market is
searching for a fair price. It's trying this and traders decide that the price
is too low. So we rally up in a pretty strong full micro channel. And the rally
is a search for sellers. Not enough sellers here. The market has to go higher
to find sellers. I said 60% of the time the range overlaps the range before.
Well, look at this. The bottom of this range did not overlap the top of this
range and that's a sign that the bulls are a little bit stronger. However, we
got this breakout and formed another range. The upper range did overlap the
lower range quite a little bit. Every time you get a reasonably strong
breakout, the market is telling you that the price is still too low. It has to
find sellers and it has to go higher to find them. Again, I mentioned that in
this particular case, Even though there's a 60 chance the range will overlap
the prior range, there's a 40% chance it will not. And here we have a gap. The
top of the lower range and the bottom of the upper range, a sign of strong
bulls. The bears were unable to close the gap and it increases the chances that
we're going higher. So when you're starting to get this breakout, you have to
assume this actually better than a 5050 chance that the breakout will be successful.
Here we do have overlap. The third trading range overlaps the second and it's a
sign that the trend is weakening. Strong bear breakout, bare micro channel, a
lot of consecutive be bars closing neither lows. Chances are we're going at
least a little bit lower. Maybe this is a little bit lower, maybe this is a
little bit lower. But big down, big up, probably trading range. And then we
have another be breakout lasting a few bars. In fact only one or two bars below
the low of the upper range. As usual, 60% chance the top of the lower range
will overlap the bottom of the upper range by at least a little bit. Then after
20 to 30 bars, it's in breakout mode and you can get trend resumption down or
trend reversal up. The probability of the two is about the same after about 20
or 30 bars. In this particular case, the market decided that the price was too
low and had to go higher to find sellers. This is common. At the end of the
session, the market decides, will the bear trend resume? Will it reverse like
it did here, or will it simply continue sideways into the end of the day? You
can see videos on trading ranges and trading the end of the day for more
information about what takes place at the end of the session. Again, the Euro
versus the dollar. A five minute chart. There's actually a wedge bottom here.
Can you see it? Three pushes down. One, two, three. I know the second push
falls below the line connecting the first and third, but that's common. We have
a bear trend. And then late in the bear trend after 20, 30 bars. Here, after 50
or 60 or 70 bars, the market enters a triangle. Triangles rarely are perfect,
but this is one way to draw it. A high. A second push, a third push again, does
not matter that the second is above the first. The overall idea is that we're
narrowing, we're getting to a narrower, tight training range. And we have at
least three pushes up or down. You can argue three down. A bull breakout that
reversed. Then you can restart the count. One, maybe two, and then three. In
any case, it's a breakout board situation. When you do get a triangle late in a
trend, here we go, a bear train. And you get trend resumption. You have to
think that the odds are usually 60 or 70% that the triangle will be the final
bear flag and that it will lead to a reversal, as it did here and it did in the
form of a wedge. Probably will get at least two legs sideways to up one
pullback too. I'm finally going to be talking about trends that are in broad
channels. We're in a bear trend and we have deep pullbacks, but in general
still forming lower highs and lower lows. It's a stairs pattern. Here's the
breakout, but the pullback goes above the bottom of the breakout. There's the
breakout point. And the pullback goes above the breakout point. And all the way
down there's the breakout point. And we have a pullback. Above the bottom of
the breakout point. There's another breakout and it reversed up back above the
bottom of the breakout. And when the pullbacks overlap the breakout points, I
call it a stairs pattern. We're stair stepping down. Pullback above the
breakout point, pullback above the breakout point. So that's a stairs pattern
and that's important to recognize. That tells you that bulls who are buying at
this low and scaling in lower are making money. And that is a sign of a weak
trend and a sign that the market will probably enter a trading range before too
long. A broad bear channel always has 20 or 30 bars in it that are also in our
trading range. And a lot of times when you look at the chart, you're not sure
if it's in a bear trend or in a trading range or if the bear trend has ended
and convert it into a trading range. When you're not sure whether it's still a
bear trend, a bear channel or a trading range does not matter. You trade it
like a trading range. You look to buy low, sell high and scalp. So you buy low,
buy in the bottom third and you scalp somewhere in the middle. On rallies, when
they reverse down, you sell that. Since we still are in a bear trend, you can
swing trade the sell offs, the bear entries. But in general, a lot of traders
simply scalp them because they're not sure whether the trading range will
continue for a lot more bars and they'd rather just sell and scalp. Sell and
scalp. Sell and scalp. A lot of times when the market is selling off like this
and then you enter a trading range, you're not sure what's going on. Are we
forming a wedge? Are we forming a lower low? Major trend reversal? Are we
forming a trading range? We're getting lower highs and lower lows. The answer
is all of that. It's obviously still in a beer trend, it's obviously in a
trading range and it's obviously forming a wedge bottom and a lower low. Major
trend reverse. Because it is still in a bear trend, a lot of traders will swing
at least part of their position when they're selling for the longs. We're not
yet in a bull trend, so any long is a scalp. So traders taking counter trend
positions here the trend is down. So the counter trend position is buying and
bear trends. So when you're buying, you're buying only for a scalp. Traders
will sell reversals down from the top of the channel. The channel, it rarely is
exact. Sometimes on television or on the web, you'll see channels that look
perfectly parallel. But that's not how channels typically look. The channels
are really exact. You have to keep redrawing the lines and anytime the market
is near the top of the channel, look to sell reversals down. We're in a bare
trend, so it's less important to buy reversals up from new lows. Although when
traders see a lot of two sided price action and they start to see pullbacks
going above breakout points, a lot of traders will buy reversals up from new
lows. For scalps, three pushes down, 1, 2, 3 second entry for a failed breakout
below a prior low common in trading rangers. So some bulls will buy that at
least for a scalp, double top bear flag and a bull breakout. You can say head
and shoulders, bottom left shoulder, head right shoulder. However, we're still
in a bear trend and you have to be ready for the bull breakout to fail. When
you have a double top and a bull breakout that fails, I think of that as a
variation of a wedge. We have three pushes up, one, two for the double top bear
flag and then the bull breakout is the third push. For me. Functionally this is
the same as a wedge bear flag. And I'm expecting at least a couple like
sideways to down one pullback too. A reasonable sell. They'll break out above a
double top bear flag, another lower high in a bear trend. A decent sell signal
bar traders at this point redraw the channel. That way we got a breakout above
the channel, another reversal down. Traders will sell below that bar. Even
though It's a bull bar. We have another double top bear flag and a bear
channel. A new low stair stepping down. Traders will buy a reversal up or
they'll simply buy at that low and then they're willing to buy more lower
again. When you're buying in a bear trend or in a trading range, it's better
only to scalp. After every reversal down, you redraw the line. And then when
you test that new line, traders will look to sell a reversal down again. After
every new high, you draw a new line and you see how the market behaves at that
line. Can you sell a reversal down here or reversal down there? You can draw
the line that way, you can draw the line this way, or you can simply say
another new low and a broad fair channel. So traders should buy reversals up or
they simply buy at that higher low, looking for a scalp. Bears, they also look
to sell somewhere in the middle of the last bear leg. So we have a bear leg.
Here's the middle third of that fair leg. Traders will look to sell somewhere
in the middle third. For example, a breakout into the middle third. And then we
have a bear bar reversing down. So traders will sell below there or below here.
Another bare leg starting here or here. This is the middle third. Traders will
look to sell somewhere in the middle third if they get a reversal down. For
example, we're breaking out to the upside. Traders will look to sell below the
lower bar, betting that a pullback to the middle third of the prior bear leg
will result in another lower high. We're getting lower highs. The same here.
Most recent pair, like traders look for a pullback somewhere to the middle of
that barrel leg. And then they sell reversal down, expecting another new low in
the bear trend. And bears take profits at the prior lows. So the bears who sell
here will take at least partial profits at the prior low. The bears sell here,
they'll take profits around the prior low. Bears to sell here, they'll take
profits around the prior low. Bulls who buy, they're looking to scalp out
somewhere in the middle third where the bears are going short. So for example,
a bull who places a limit or goodbye at the slow he gets filled, he'll look to
sell take profits for a scalp somewhere in the middle third. And one way to do
it is either with a limit order at a certain number of ticks or pips or simply
sell the reversal down. Take your profits there. A bull buying at this low sees
the market continuing down. However, he's confident that because we're in A
stairs pattern. We're going to get back above this breakout point. So some of
the bulls who buy here will buy more down here. Their second purchase is at
least the size of a typical scalp because if it does continue down like this, a
lot of them will try to get out or on their first entry break even on their
first and with the scalp on their second. So they want to make sure that that
second entry is at least the size of a scalp below the first. So you buy here,
buy more here, and then look to exit around the original entry. Bears, they're
looking to sell around the middle third. Anytime there's a reversal down here
we have a breakout and a pullback below the breakout, a breakout and a pullback
below the breakout. So it's a stairs pattern. But what do you notice about the
stairs pattern? The size of this breakout from this high to that high is less
than the size of the breakout from this high to that high. So the stairs are
shrinking. The bulls are less confident that the market's going to continue
higher. So the quicker to take profits, the bears are more confident that it's
going to evolve into a trading range soon and they're more eager to sell. So
the height of this breakout is two ticks and the height of that breakout is
only one tick. It's also three pushes up. One, two, three. So wedge top. When
you see a shrinking stairs pattern, you have to be thinking that the bull
channel is probably ending and that the market will soon evolve into a trading
range. Once it falls below a major higher low, then the pattern of higher lows
is no longer still intact. And if the market's not making higher lows, it's no
longer in a bull trend. It's either in a bear trend or a trading range. This
sell off is not particularly strong. It does not have consecutive big bear
trend bars and is finding support at that major higher low. This looks more
like a bare leg and what will become a trading range. In any case, it's no
longer a bull trend. Here are shrinking bear stairs. That's the size of that
breakout. The next breakout is smaller before the bulls come in. Next breakout,
smaller. Next breakout smaller. Well, the bears are taking profits faster and
the bulls are more eager. 17 pip breakout. Before we get a pullback over here,
the market only fell 6 piss below the breakout point before we got the pullback
and then we ended up with a double bottom. Higher low. Major trend reversal.
Head and shoulders, bottom, left shoulder and right shoulder. The loss of
momentum, the loss of strength on the part of the Bears means that the bear
trend probably is ending and the market will probably enter a trading range or
possibly a bull trend. And once you break above a major lower high like this, a
strong bear breakout for new low. So this lower high is major. Once you break
above it, the market is no longer in a bear trend. It's then either in a
trading range or in a full trend. And at this point you can say, wow, that's a
bull trend. Well, not necessarily. We're still below the top of the bear trend.
And this might simply be a bull, like in a trading range. In any case, it's no
longer a bear. Here's a daily chart of the Euro versus the dollar. Again, a
trend continues as long as it's making major higher lows. We have a series of
higher lows and higher highs. So we're in a bull trend, but we're getting very
deep pullbacks. And some of the pullbacks are strong enough so that traders
would conclude that the market is always, in short, no longer always in long,
yet we're still forming higher lows and higher highs. So even though there are
times when the reversals down are enough to make traders believe we're always
in short, the big picture is we're still in a bull trend. We have bull channel
with very deep pullbacks, strong their pullbacks, but we're continuing to form
new higher lows. It's a broad bull channel. The bulls are looking for pullbacks
to the middle third or so of the prior bull leg. And they'll look to buy in the
middle third or they'll buy a reversal up here, a bull trendable leg. Here's a
pullback into that middle third. Also looking to buy here, another leg up. This
is the middle of that leg up. The bulls are looking to buy somewhere in the
middle of that last leg up. Higher probability of profit if traders are buying
above a bull bar or after a second leg down. So one pullback, two micro double
bottom, small bull bar, higher probability buying above that. Two legs down,
one pullback, two does not really look like two legs, but it is two small legs
and then one pullback, two. Maybe this is already two legs double bottom. So it
might be one and then new high. But part of the correction from this side and
two legs down. But anyway, it's a double bottom in the middle third.
Traditional buy reversal up micro double bottom. They'll buy in reverse 1.
Which bull flag? They'll buy a reversal up. We're still in the middle third.
They'll buy a reversal up and bulls are taking profits at new highs. You know
that because the market is going down, market makes a new high and it goes
down. That means traders are selling, bulls are selling to take profits, bears
are selling to go short. Even though the breakout here was strong, look what
happened. The pullback eventually fell below the top of the breakout. And
that's telling us that it's okay to start selling at new highs. Using wide stops
and scaling in bear sell. New highs for scalps here, they probably would sell
more here and get out break even on their first entry with profit on the second
entry. Here it immediately went down. So they simply scalp out somewhere in the
middle third of the last full leg. Here a bear would sell, keeps going up, sell
more and then try to get out break even on their first entry and then with a
profit on their second entry. If they sell at the prior high and it immediately
goes down, they simply take their profits somewhere in the middle third of the
most recent bull life. Same here. They sold did not go up high enough for them
to scale in, but it did pull back into the middle third of the most recent bull
leg and they took profits. In this video I talked about three types of trends.
The trend from the open trend, a trend that begins on the first bar or second
or third bar of a session. And next talk about trending trading range days
where early in the session there's a trading range. But the trading range is
only about half of the height of a typical daily range. So traders expect the
range to double. And finally I talked about broad channels, for example, a
broad bull channel as deep pullbacks. And sometimes the sell offs are so strong
the market is always in short, at least for a little bit, yet it reverses up
from a higher low. So the series of higher highs and higher lows continues and
therefore the market is in a bull channel, which is a type of bull trend. I'm
