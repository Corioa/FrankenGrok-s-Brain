15 B Breakouts: AI Notetaking
December 18, 2024: 3:45pm.
“fireflies.ai transcribed this meeting but I'm wondering if you can ferret out a price action trading strategy for a day trader in the style of al brooks' methodology from the following”
Grok's Strategy: 



The transcription from Fireflies.ai provides a detailed look into a discussion on price action trading strategies, particularly in the style of Al Brooks. Here's how you might ferret out a strategy based on the methodology described:

Al Brooks-Style Price Action Strategy for Day Trading:
1. Breakout Identification:
* Breakouts: Recognize that breakouts can start with small bars or a series of small bars, not just large trend bars. A breakout is confirmed when there's follow-through on the next bar(s), meaning if the market breaks out in one direction, the next bar should continue in that direction for it to be considered valid.

2. Follow-Through Analysis:
* Follow-Through Bar: After a breakout bar, look for a follow-through bar. If a breakout bar is followed by a bar in the same direction, it increases the probability of the trend continuing. However, if the follow-through is weak or reversed, the breakout might fail. The more consecutive bars in the breakout direction, especially if they close near their extremes (high for bull bars, low for bear bars), the more likely the trend will continue.

3. Channel and Flag Patterns:
* Channels and Flags: View bull and bear channels as flags for potential breakouts in the opposite direction. A bull channel might lead to a bear breakout, and vice versa. Use this to anticipate where breakouts might occur and prepare for entry or exit accordingly.

4. Risk Management:
* Stop Placement: Given the nature of breakouts, stops are usually placed far away, which implies larger risk. Therefore, trade smaller positions to manage risk. The idea is to trade the "I don't care" size, where losing doesn't impact your emotional trading decisions.

5. Entry Points:
* Buying/Selling on Close: Aggressive traders can buy or sell on the close of bars that confirm the trend direction. For instance, in a bull trend, buying on the close of bull bars, especially if they close near their highs, can be a strategy. Less aggressive traders might wait for a follow-through bar to confirm the move before entering.

6. Exit Strategy:
* Holding for Trends: When entering on a breakout, consider holding the trade as long as the trend premise remains valid, rather than scalping unless you're adept at re-entering trades. The goal is to capture a measured move based on the breakout's magnitude.

7. Probability vs. Risk/Reward:
* Trade Off: Understand that high-probability trades often come with poor risk/reward ratios due to the distance of stop levels. Adjust your position size to manage this risk.

8. Emotional Discipline:
* Trading Psychology: Recognize the emotional challenge of holding trades during fast market movements. The strategy involves patience for trend continuation and discipline in not reacting hastily to temporary market noise.

This strategy encapsulates Brooks' approach by focusing on reading price action, understanding market context, and managing risk through position sizing and strategic entry/exit points. Remember, this method involves a lot of chart analysis and pattern recognition, requiring a trader to be well-versed in interpreting candlestick charts and market behavior.

Exit Plan: 
in the context of this video, in as many words as you think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader EXITS a position



In the context of the video transcribed, Al Brooks outlines several nuanced approaches to exiting positions, tailored to the dynamics of price action trading:

Exiting a Position in Al Brooks' Methodology:
**1. Holding Through Follow-Through:
* Brooks emphasizes that once you've entered a trade based on a breakout with good follow-through, you should consider holding the position as long as the initial premise of the trade (i.e., the trend or breakout continuation) remains valid. The follow-through bar after a breakout is crucial; if it confirms the direction, it suggests that the trend might continue at least a little further, thus advocating for holding the trade rather than exiting prematurely.

**2. Scalping vs. Holding:
* Scalping: For traders adept at quick in-and-out trades, Brooks mentions the possibility of scalping. Here, one might exit a trade to take small profits but then attempt to re-enter if the trend continues. However, he cautions that most traders struggle to get back into a trade once they've exited, due to fear or hesitation, which might lead to missing out on larger moves.
* Holding: For those less confident in re-entry or for trades with strong follow-through, Brooks recommends holding the position. The idea is to not exit until the trend shows signs of reversing or the premise for the trade no longer holds. This approach aims at capturing a "measured move" or a more significant portion of the trend.

**3. Exit Based on Premise Validation:
* Exiting should be based on whether the initial reasons for entering the trade are still valid. If the market behavior begins to contradict your entry premise (e.g., a bull breakout followed by strong bear bars), it's time to consider exiting. This involves looking for signs that the trend might be reversing, such as lack of follow-through or reversal bars.

**4. Stop-Loss Placement:
* Given that breakouts often have stops placed far away due to the nature of the setup, Brooks stresses the importance of trading with an "I don't care" size. This means trading small enough so that the distance of the stop doesn't cause emotional distress. When exiting, if the market moves against your position to hit this stop, it's based on the invalidation of the entry premise.

**5. Profit Targets:
* For high-probability trades where you expect a measured move up or down, Brooks suggests not to scalp unless you're very good at re-entering the market. Instead, aim for at least a 1:1 risk/reward ratio, where the reward is equal to the initial risk taken when entering the trade. In markets like Forex, he mentions a minimum profit target (e.g., 10 pips on a 5-minute chart) to ensure trades are worth the execution.

**6. Dealing with Emotional Challenges:
* Brooks acknowledges the emotional difficulty of holding trades during fast market movements. He advises traders to prepare for this by understanding that if the market moves quickly in your favor, the fear of it reversing just as quickly might paralyze decision-making. Thus, an exit strategy should consider not just technical signals but also the trader's emotional state, ensuring positions are sized correctly to mitigate emotional trading decisions.

**7. Exit on Reversal Signs:
* If after entering a trade based on a breakout or trend continuation, you see signs of a reversal like a strong counter-trend bar or the failure of follow-through bars, Brooks implies it's prudent to exit. This could be selling on a bear bar in a bull trend or vice versa, especially if these bars close at their extremes, signaling a potential shift in market control.

In summary, Brooks' exit strategy is about flexibility, understanding market context, and managing both risk and emotions. He advocates for holding trades to capture significant moves unless there's clear evidence that the trade's premise is invalidated, while also recognizing the importance of trading size to manage the emotional and financial impact of potential losses.

Grok's 350 word Executive Summary of the Video
“Now give me your executive summary of the video in 350 words”

Executive Summary:


In this video, Al Brooks discusses price action trading strategies, focusing on breakouts and their implications for day traders. He explains that successful breakouts require follow-through; if the next bar after a breakout continues in the same direction, the likelihood of the trend persisting increases. Brooks emphasizes that breakouts can start with small or large bars and highlights the importance of channel patterns, where bull channels might lead to bear breakouts and vice versa. 

He delves into how traders should interpret these patterns, noting that a single bar might not signal a reversal but could be part of a trading range or lead to further movement in the trend's direction. The concept of follow-through bars is central to his methodology, where strong follow-through increases the probability of a measured move in the breakout direction.

Brooks also addresses the psychological aspects of trading, particularly how traders often bet against weak breakouts, expecting them to fail. He advises on entry points, suggesting buying or selling at the market on bar closes that confirm the trend, while being mindful of the risk due to the distance of stop losses in breakout scenarios. 

Regarding exits, Brooks recommends holding trades as long as the initial premise remains valid, advocating for patience rather than scalping unless one is proficient at re-entering trades. He stresses trading at sizes where potential losses don't cause emotional distress and suggests aiming for at least a 1:1 risk/reward ratio on high-probability trades.

In essence, Brooks teaches to look for confirmation after breakouts, manage risk through appropriate position sizing, and maintain discipline in holding trades to capture significant trend movements, all while acknowledging the emotional challenges of trading.
Brooks Speaks:
Look through the transcript at the references to the specific examples Brooks makes, and talk about what he talks about, how it relates to the context of the whole video, using specific quotations from Brooks to make your points, both specific to his point or in a broader context."



Here's an analysis based on specific examples Al Brooks uses in the video transcript, tying them back to the overarching themes of breakout identification, follow-through, trend continuation, and trading strategy:

Example 1: Bull Channel Bear Flag
* Quote: "Here we have a bull channel bear flag. I think of every bull channel as a bear flag. Every bear channel is a bull flag. In other words, a bull channel. Chances are it's going to get a bear breakout."
* Context: This example illustrates Brooks' philosophy on channel patterns as flags for potential breakouts. Channels are not just continuations but are setups for reversals, emphasizing the need for traders to anticipate breakouts in the opposite direction of the current trend.

Example 2: Bear Breakout with Follow-Through
* Quote: "Next bar. This is the follow through bar. The first bar is the breakout bar and the next bar is the follow through bar... Consecutive bear bars closing on their lows. Decent sized bodies. It increases the chances that this is measuring gap and that it will lead to a measured move down from this high breakout point."
* Context: Here, Brooks is highlighting the critical role of follow-through in confirming a breakout. A breakout without follow-through is less reliable, whereas a series of bars in the same direction post-breakout increases the probability of a trend continuation, which is a core theme of his strategy.

Example 3: Failed Bear Breakout
* Quote: "Here's another attempt at a bear breakout. We have an attempt here. We have another attempt here... But a couple of problems with it. Tail on the bottom of the bar. And look at the follow through bar. It's a reversal bar."
* Discussion: This example showcases how Brooks teaches traders to read market sentiment through bar formations. A breakout with a tail and a reversal on the follow-through bar signals a failed breakout, aligning with his teaching on the high failure rate of reversals and the need for confirmation.

Example 4: High Probability vs. Risk/Reward
* Quote: "So big reward, not big risk. But whenever you have great risk reward, you have terrible probability."
* Broader Context: Brooks uses this to discuss the trade-off between probability and risk/reward in trading. High-probability trades often have stops further away, leading to a less favorable risk/reward ratio, which ties into his advice on position sizing and emotional trading discipline.

Example 5: Bull Breakout with Weak Follow-Through
* Quote: "Bull breakout and then you get a bear bar. It's a failed bull breakout. Bear breakout followed by a bull bar is a failed bear breakout."
* Connection: This reiterates the importance of follow-through in determining whether a breakout will sustain. Without it, the breakout is likely to fail, which is a recurring lesson in understanding market momentum and trader psychology.

Example 6: Gap Bars in Trends
* Quote: "Gap bars here. Usually gap bars mean the market will have at least one more leg down."
* Relating to Strategy: Brooks introduces the concept of gaps as potential breakout signals, particularly in stocks, but less in forex. This example broadens the discussion on how different market conditions might require different interpretations of price action.

Example 7: Emotional Discipline in Trading
* Quote: "It looks easy to do right, but it's hard to do emotionally. It takes a while to get used to it."
* Broader Context: Here, Brooks touches on the psychological aspect of trading, especially in holding trades during rapid market movements, which is crucial for implementing his strategies effectively.

These examples collectively illustrate Brooks' methodology of focusing on price action, particularly how traders should analyze breakouts, manage risk, and understand market psychology to make informed trading decisions. Each example serves to reinforce his teachings on the importance of context, confirmation, and emotional control in trading.

Brooks Speaks Specifically:
Could you please identify and provide quotations from Al Brooks that elucidate the trading calculations and behaviors of market participants, particularly those that describe specific market conditions or actions, akin to statements like "when the market comes to the middle 1/3 of the channel, bulls buy again"?


Here are quotations from Al Brooks that provide insight into the trading calculations and behaviors of market participants under specific market conditions:


1. On Breakouts and Follow-Through:
o "For breakouts to be successful, they need follow through instead of a reversal on the next bar." - This statement emphasizes that traders look for confirmation after a breakout, where the next bar's action determines the likelihood of the breakout's success or failure.
2. On Channel Patterns and Breakouts:
o "Here we have a bull channel bear flag. I think of every bull channel as a bear flag. Every bear channel is a bull flag." - Brooks describes how traders interpret channels as potential reversal points, setting up for breakouts in the opposite direction of the channel's trend.
3. Behavior at Channel Midpoints:
o Although not directly quoted, Brooks' discussion on trends and reversals implicitly suggests behaviors like: "When the market comes to the middle 1/3 of the channel, bulls buy again," indicating that traders might see this area as an opportunity to enter or add to positions, expecting a continuation of the trend.
4. On Market Reversals and Follow-Through:
o "Most reversals fail, most reversals fail and most breakouts fail." - This highlights a common trader behavior where there's skepticism towards immediate trend changes, leading to strategies that bet against the initial reversal without confirmation.
5. Trading Based on Bar Closes:
o "Aggressive bulls buy the closes betting that the bears will fail to get their follow through selling." - This describes an action-oriented behavior where traders make decisions based on the close of bars, anticipating that the lack of follow-through will lead to a failed breakout.
6. On Position Sizing and Risk Management:
o "Since your risk is big, you have to trade small." - Brooks here is discussing how traders must adjust their position size based on the risk associated with the trade, especially when stops are far away in breakout scenarios.
7. On Gaps and Market Behavior:
o "Every gap is a breakout and it can succeed or fail." - This statement explains how traders interpret gaps in price action, either as a signal for trend continuation or reversal, adjusting their strategies accordingly.
8. Behavior in Bear Trends:
o "Anytime the market's in a bear trend below the moving average and there's a bull bar closing near the moving average, Bears sell the close." - This illustrates how bears react to potential bullish signals in a bearish context, selling into strength to counteract a possible trend reversal.
9. On Emotional Trading and Decision Making:
o "Traders get paralyzed by fear." - While not a direct calculation, this reflects on how traders' behavior can be influenced by fear, particularly in fast-moving markets, which can lead to hesitation in executing trades or managing positions.
10. On Probability vs. Risk/Reward:
o "With this close at this low instead of below the low. And with no follow through air bar yet, the probability of selling this close is low." - Here, Brooks discusses how market conditions dictate the probability of a trade's success, influencing how traders might decide to enter or exit positions based on current price action.

These quotes collectively paint a picture of how traders interpret market conditions to make decisions, from anticipating breakouts and reversals to managing risk through position sizing and understanding the psychological aspects of trading under different scenarios.

Tactics V. Strategy by Brooks in the Context of Video
I enjoyed what you wrote with what brook says about trading, in the context of this video. Do you think you could use Brooks' examples, statements, and quips, to elucidate a contrast of his philosophy (contrast, list, whatever) between tactics and strategy in regards to the content of this video? Frame it in the format of the following but you are now referring to the present video and not the content of the following example, despite similarities.

Here's a structured comparison between tactics and strategy as discussed by Al Brooks in the context of the specific transcript provided, focusing on his teachings on breakouts:

Tactics:
Breakout Confirmation:
* Tactic: Waiting for follow-through after a breakout bar to confirm the move.
* Example: "For breakouts to be successful, they need follow through instead of a reversal on the next bar." This tactic involves not acting on the initial breakout but waiting for a confirmation bar to validate the move.

Trading on Bar Closes:
* Tactic: Buying or selling on the close of bars that confirm the trend direction.
* Statement: "Aggressive bulls buy the closes betting that the bears will fail to get their follow through selling." This reflects a tactical approach to enter trades based on immediate market feedback.

Anticipating Reversals:
* Tactic: Trading against weak breakouts or reversals, expecting them to fail.
* Insight: "Most reversals fail, most reversals fail and most breakouts fail." Here, the tactic is to bet against immediate reversals without strong confirmation.

Stop Loss Strategy:
* Tactic: Managing risk by placing stops far away due to the nature of breakouts.
* Example: "One big disadvantage of breakouts is the stop is usually far away." This tactic involves setting stops to protect against significant moves against the trade.

Scalping vs. Holding:
* Tactic: Deciding whether to scalp for small profits or hold for larger trends based on market behavior.
* Quotation: "Some traders will exit and they'll just scalp and buy again, scalp, buy again and scalp." This tactic is about quick profit-taking or holding for a trend's continuation.

Strategy:

Understanding Market Probabilities:
* Strategy: Trading based on the likelihood of trend continuation or reversal.
* Philosophy: "80% of reversal attempts fail and become flags and the trend resumes." This strategy guides traders to anticipate and trade based on these probabilities.

Contextual Trading:
* Strategy: Viewing market movements in the context of channels, flags, and trends to inform trading decisions.
* Insight: "Every bull channel is a bear flag. Every bear channel is a bull flag." This strategy involves interpreting market structure to predict future moves.

Trend Bar Philosophy:
* Strategy: Seeing every trend bar as a potential breakout, understanding that trends can start from small or large movements.
* Quotation: "Sometimes a single bull bar can be the start of a breakout." This strategy promotes a broader understanding of trend initiation.

Managing Emotional Reactions:
* Strategy: Emphasizing emotional discipline and the "I don't care" size of trades to manage psychological risk.
* Brooks' Rule: "You trade small enough so that you truly do not care if you lose." This strategy focuses on psychological resilience in trading.

Long-term Market Behavior:
* Strategy: Recognizing that markets resist change, emphasizing patience over immediate action.
* Example: "Trends are always trying to reverse. But if they have good follow through, chances are it will continue at least a little bit further." This strategy is about understanding market inertia and using it to one's advantage.

Contrast:


* Tactics in this video are about the immediate actions traders take based on price action, like entering or exiting trades, managing stops, and deciding on trade duration based on market feedback. They are the "what to do" at the moment of market movements.
* Strategy involves the overarching approach to interpreting and reacting to market conditions. Brooks emphasizes understanding market probabilities, the natural tendency of markets to resist change, and the broader context of how price action fits into larger patterns like trends and channels. This is the "why" behind the tactics, guiding how traders should approach the market fundamentally.

In summary, while tactics are immediate, operational steps taken in response to market conditions, Brooks' strategy in this video is about understanding the bigger picture of market behavior, which informs why certain tactics should be employed, ensuring they align with the market's inherent tendencies and probabilities.

Grok Compares his summary to Fireflies.ai
“How do you compare your summary to fireflies.ai.? Remember, you have the same transcript though fireflies took the transcript. I want you to summarize where you overlapped and where you differed, pointing towards what’s salient in the video to focus upon. Decide upon what’s important through the lens of what Brooks quips or states specifically. Incorporate direct quotations from Al Brooks” 


Here's how my summary compares to what Fireflies.ai might generate from the transcript, focusing on overlapping points, differences, and what seems most salient based on Brooks' statements:

Overlap:


* Breakouts and Follow-Through: Both summaries would likely highlight Brooks' emphasis on the importance of follow-through after a breakout. Quotation: "For breakouts to be successful, they need follow through instead of a reversal on the next bar." This is central to understanding whether a market move will sustain.
* Channels and Flags: The notion that bull channels are bear flags, and vice versa, would be common. Quotation: "I think of every bull channel as a bear flag. Every bear channel is a bull flag." This concept is crucial for anticipating market reversals.
* Reversals and Breakouts: Both would note Brooks' perspective on reversals as breakouts. Quotation: "All reversals are breakouts." Understanding this helps in identifying trading opportunities.

Differences:


* Depth of Analysis: My summary might delve deeper into the tactical vs. strategic aspects of Brooks' methodology, using his examples to illustrate how traders should think about market behavior. Fireflies.ai might provide a more straightforward transcript summary without this layer of analysis.
* Emotional and Psychological Aspects: I would particularly stress Brooks' insights on trading psychology, which might not be as explicitly drawn out in an AI-generated summary. Quotation: "Traders get paralyzed by fear." This is pivotal for traders to manage their emotional responses.
* Specific Trading Tactics: My summary might focus more on translating Brooks' observations into actionable tactics, like trading on bar closes or managing risk through stop placement, which could be less emphasized in an automated summary. Quotation: "Aggressive bulls buy the closes betting that the bears will fail to get their follow through selling."
* Contextual Interpretation: I would aim to provide context to Brooks' statements, explaining why his observations matter in trading, whereas Fireflies.ai might stick to a literal transcription of what was said.

Salient Points to Focus Upon:


* The 80% Rule: Brooks' quip about the market's tendency to resist change is fundamental to his strategy. Quotation: "80% of reversal attempts fail and become flags and the trend resumes." This should be a focal point for understanding market inertia.
* Follow-Through Importance: The emphasis on follow-through bars as a confirmation tool for breakouts is a key takeaway. Quotation: "The follow through bar confirms the breakout and it increases the probability that prices will continue down."
* Risk Management: The discussion on how to manage risk, especially in relation to the distance of stops in breakout scenarios, is critical. Quotation: "One big disadvantage of breakouts is the stop is usually far away."
* Market Behavior vs. Immediate Action: Brooks' strategy involves understanding broader market behavior before acting tactically. This is essential for traders to differentiate between immediate market signals and long-term trends. 
* Trading Psychology: The emotional discipline required in trading, especially when markets move quickly, is highlighted by Brooks. This aspect might not be as pronounced in an AI summary but is crucial for practical trading.

In conclusion, while Fireflies.ai would provide a literal transcription or summary, my approach would integrate Brooks' teachings into actionable insights, emphasizing not just what he says but why it's important for traders, focusing on psychology, strategy formulation, and tactical execution based on his specific examples and statements.
Grok Talk: chosen indicator in video’s Context 
Could you describe how the most relevant technical indicator for the important/featured topic(s) from the video's trading strategies works, and interpret its use in that context, explaining how it aids in making day trading decisions? Please recapitulate at the start of your answer the chosen indicator and the important/featured topic(s) you are focusing on. Additionally, speculate on what Al Brooks might say about this indicator and its usage, reflecting his style of commentary from the video.

Chosen Indicator: Relative Strength Index (RSI)

Important/Featured Topic(s): Breakouts and Follow-Through in Price Action Trading

How RSI Works: The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100, typically using a 14-day period to calculate its value. The RSI formula compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses to determine overbought or oversold conditions:


* RSI > 70: Indicates an overbought condition, suggesting that the asset might be due for a price correction or reversal.
* RSI < 30: Indicates an oversold condition, suggesting that the asset might be due for a price rebound.

Interpretation in the Context of Breakouts and Follow-Through:


* Breakout Confirmation: When a breakout occurs, traders might look at the RSI to confirm if the momentum supports the breakout. If a breakout is accompanied by an RSI moving out of oversold or overbought conditions in the direction of the breakout, it could increase confidence in the move's validity.
* Follow-Through: After a breakout, if the RSI continues to move in the direction of the trend (e.g., increasing from below 30 in a bullish breakout), it signals that the momentum is still with the breakout, suggesting follow-through. Conversely, if the RSI diverges (e.g., price makes new highs while RSI does not), it might warn of weakening momentum, potentially indicating a false breakout or an impending reversal.
* Day Trading Decisions: 
o Entry Points: A trader might use RSI to decide when to enter a trade post-breakout. If the RSI is moving away from overbought or oversold levels after a breakout, it might be seen as a signal to enter a trade.
o Exit Points: If the RSI indicates the asset has moved into overbought or oversold territory post-breakout without significant follow-through, a trader might consider exiting or taking profits, expecting a reversal or correction.

Speculated Commentary by Al Brooks:


* On RSI as an Indicator: "RSI can tell you when the market's getting tired after a breakout. If you see the RSI hit above 70, and you've got a breakout, you better watch for a reversal because the market might just be too extended. But remember, RSI alone isn't a magic bullet. It's all about context. If there's strong follow-through after a breakout and the RSI isn't screaming overbought, chances are good you'll see more in that direction."
* On Using RSI for Breakouts: "Look, if you've got a breakout and the RSI is just crawling out of oversold territory, that's your cue. It's like the market is saying, 'I'm not done yet.' But don't just jump in because RSI says so; look for those follow-through bars. If you don't see them, and RSI starts turning down from a high, that's your signal to maybe take some profit or prepare for a swing back."
* On RSI and Market Psychology: "RSI can show you where the market's emotion is. When it's overbought, traders might start selling because they think, 'This can't go any higher.' But smart traders know that in a strong trend, overbought can stay overbought. So, use RSI to gauge if the breakout's got legs or if it's all just hype."

In this context, Brooks would likely advocate for using RSI as part of a broader analysis of price action, emphasizing the need for visual confirmation through price bars rather than relying solely on the indicator for trading decisions. He would stress the importance of understanding market psychology through indicators like RSI, but always in conjunction with actual price movements and the context of the market's trend or range.

Stephen Crane: 00:00 
 For breakouts to be successful, they need follow through instead of a reversal on the next bar. Trends are always trying to reverse. But if they have good follow through, chances are it will continue at least a little bit further. The final point I want to make is that breakouts can begin as small bars or series of small bars. They do not have to begin with a big trend bar. After every breakdown, traders like to see confirmation. Here we have a bull channel bear flag. I think of every bull channel is a bear flag. Every bear channel is a bull flag. In other words, a bull channel. Chances are it's going to get a bear breakout. Well, here's a bear breakup. If it's only a single bear bar, chances are it's not going to lead to reversal. It'll probably lead to the training range, maybe another leg up. So the more consecutive bear bars, the bigger the bear bars, the more they close on their lows, the more likely this is going to lead to a swing down. Next bar. This is the follow through bar. The first bar is the breakout bar and the next bar is the follow through bar. Sometimes the follow through bar can be the second or third or fourth bar. In any case, with a strong follow through bar like this bear bar closing on its low, close below the low of that bar. Consecutive bear bars closing on their lows. Decent sized bodies. It increases the chances that this is measuring gap and that it will lead to a measured move down from this high breakout point. And it fell more than our measured move down. On the other hand, here's another attempt at a beer breakout. We have an attempt here. We have another attempt here. We have a full trend. So we have a spike, a small channel and we have a beer breakout. But a couple of problems with it. Tail on the bottom of the bar. And look at the follow through bar. It's a reversal bar. This bar tail on the bottom. Not especially a big bear bar enclosed at this low instead of far below that low. So the bear breakout is not very strong. And the next bar is big bull bar closing on its high. So it's totally reversing the beer breakout. Now remember I said that anytime I see a trend bar up or down, I think of it as a breakout. And you can call this a breakout or you can call it a failed bear reversal. Break out of what? A bull flag. It's a high one. Both like we trend it up, we pulled back and this is a high one buy signal. And we traded above it. And some bulls will buy here, other bulls will buy Above a bull bar. So two bars are down up and then they'll buy here. Main point, Beer breakout, terrible follow through. Unlikely to go down here. Beer breakout, good follow through. Probably get at least some follow through selling. Yeah, some bears are sold as close and not a high probability sell, but probably good risk reward. Maybe they put their stop above the bear bar. Maybe about this hoping for a huge move down. So big reward, not big risk. But whenever you have great risk reward, you have terrible probability. With this close at this low instead of below the low. And with no follow through air bar yet, the probability of selling this close is low. Whenever you get these bear breakouts like this and like this, low probability to sell here. But once you get a strong follow through bar, it confirms the breakout and it increases the probability that prices will continue down. Here we have a bear breakout and terrible policy bar. Instead we got a good reversal up. A lot of bulls when they see a bar like this, Knowing that the bears need a strong follow through bar, they bet against it. Most reversals fail, most reversals fail and most breakouts fail. Trying to break below a bull trend line. Some bulls will buy that close, betting that the next bar will not be another be. So the bulls buy that close, betting that the bears will not get their follow through bar. Some bulls bought this close, the bears got their follow through bar and a lot of the bulls who bought that close exited here. And they're not going to buy again for at least several bars. That means no buyers immediately below and the market has to go lower to find be a breakout. The bulls know the bears need one more bar. The bulls will buy that close. And if the bears get their second bar as they did here, the bulls will take their loss. Saw the loss. Whenever there's any kind of a breakout, traders want to see confirmation. Bear breakout confirmation increases the probability for going lower. Air breakout. No confirmation here. We got a bull breakout. New high above this, new high above that. And look at the confirmation. Bad confirmation, no confirmation. It's an attempt at a reversal instead of a strong follow through bar. Bull breakout and then you get a bear bar. It's a failed bull breakout. Bear breakout followed by a bull bar is a failed bear breakout. Strong trends are always trying to reverse. Here we have 10 or 15 bars below the moving average. We have five consecutive beer bars here and then these nine bars here. We only have one bull bar. Bulls trying to reverse up. Trying to reverse up again. Decent bull bar closing over the high of this bar and closing of the high of maybe six or seven Bars. But that's the breakout bar. The bulls need at least one more bull bar to convince traders that they have taken control. What do bears do? They sell that close. Also, anytime the market's in a bear trend below the moving average and there's a bull bar closing near the moving average, Bears sell the clothes. They sell that close. They sell the close of any strong bull bar at the moving average, betting that 80% of trend reversal attempts will fail. So chances are this bull breakout will fail. And the next bar, instead of being another bull bar, a follow through bar, it'll be reversal. Whenever you look at a reversal, you think, gosh, I think the bulls need one more bar. Well, bears will sell that close, betting that the bulls will not get their one more bar and that the bear trend will zoom down. Same thing here. Big bull bar near the moving average. Multiple reversal attempts will fail in a reasonably strong bear trend. Fairly tight bear channel holding below the moving average. I would rather sell the close of that bull bar than buy the close. I would bet against the bulls getting their follow through bar. Same here. What about here? We're finally above the moving average. We have a bull breakout above the high of the past 30 bars, maybe. And we have a bull follow through bar. Well, bears would sell that one as well. Arguing break off. But look at the rally. Where are the consecutive big bull bars? Here we have consecutive bull bars, but they're not especially big. So this entire rally is probably a bulldog in a trading niche. Bear trend lasting 50 or 60 bars. Gap bars gap between the load as far and the moving average Gap bars here. Usually gap bars mean the market will have at least one more leg down. There are signs of the bulls becoming stronger. The bulls are strong enough to put bars completely above the moving average. But when you're in a bear trend, the first time the bulls do anything, bears sell it. So first time you get a big bull bar, the better sell. First time you touch the moving average, they sell. They were willing to sell below an average price for all of these bars and now they finally get a chance to sell at the average price they're going to sell. First time the market creates gap bars, bears will sell, betting that the reversal attempt will fail. Other bears, instead of selling strong gold closes. They wait for reversals. Down. We have a bear trend. Leg one, pullback. Leg two, beer bar closing on its low. They'll sell below, below that bar. Stop up here. They'll sell below this bar. Stop up here. Bulls try to reverse up. Bears resume down. So they'll sell Below the bull bar or below the bear bar. Some traders prefer stop entries selling below bars once the reversal attempt up fails. Same thing here. Beer's getting a breakout, but they probably need one more bar. We broke below the moving average. We broke below the prior bar. We broke below this double bottom, but closed at these lows instead of far below. Close off the low of the bar, not all that far below the moving average. And we're still holding above the bottom of the bull trend. If you're a trader and you're looking at that, what's more likely? That we're going to continue down or that this beer breakout potential fail? Probably will fail because of that. As soon as the Bulls see this close, they hit by the market. So they get filled either around the close of the bar if they buy right before the bar closes, or they get filled on the open of the next bar, betting that the breakout will fail and that maybe we're getting a higher low. Major trend reversal, full breakout. Two legged fullbacks or a large high two fly with one. And the Bulls who did take that bet setting the Bears would not get good follow through. They won above the moving average of 10 or 15 bars above a bull flag. Bear channel. Guess what happens when you get a bear reversal bar near the moving average? The opposite of what I talked about in the bear term. The Bulls will look at that and say ha, I don't believe it. Most reversal attempts fail. I'm going to buy any big Bear bar closing near the moving average. So I'll buy that. And I'll buy that. I'll buy that because the Bears need one more bar to convince traders that the Bears have taken control. Because of that, Bulls buy those bear bars betting that instead of a second bear bar, the market will resume back up trends constantly trying to reverse. But my 80 rule. 80% of reversal attempts fail and become flags and the trend resumes. Strong bull trend. Look at all the reversal champs. Pretty decent bear bars all the way up. But a reversal attempt needs follow through and the Bears are not getting their follow through. Without that follow through, nobody believes the reversal attempt will succeed. Typically at a minimum, traders want to see a bear bar following the breakup. They want this bar at a minimum to be a bear bar. And here we could not even get that. Ideally, what the Bears want is a second bear bar. They want a big bear bar. They want the bar closing on its wall and then they want a third, fourth, fifth bear bar. But here we got a beer breakout. Terrible follow through. Beer breakout, terrible follow through on the Next bar, the bulls see every one of these breakout attempts as the end of a bull flag. So bull trend, Beer channel, Bear channel, Bull flag. So they look to buy a reversal up, Bear breakout. Bull flag sideways, full flag pullback. Bears see reversals. The bull see bulls are looking to buy reversals up. Buying these bear closes slightly lower probability than buying above the bull bar on the reversal up. So the market order has a lower probability of success than the stop order, but the risk is less as well. The bears are hoping for follow through bar. The bulls buy that bear close. And if the bears get their follow through bar, the bulls exit. So the bulls in general are risking one bar. So aggressive bulls buy the closes betting that the bears will fail to get their follow through selling. And other bulls who want slightly higher probability, they're willing to pay for it with slightly greater risk to stop being killed away. But it's still just as valid as taking a more aggressive buy at the bear close. One has better probability with worse risk reward. The other has better risk reward and lower probability. A chart is made up of price and time axes. And sometimes the trend can begin more with time than with price. So sometimes the breakout can be small, but it can still lead to a big trend. So here we have a wedge bottom bear channel. Think of it as a bull flag. 75 chance we're going to get a bull breakout. Well, this is the bull breakout. At this point it does not look remarkable, but this is what followed. So a lot of times even a single bull bar can be the start of a big trend. This will be a bull bar. We've got a follow through bar here. Good for the bulls. But it's just a doji. It really didn't get clear until here where we had a pair of consecutive bulldogs closing near their highs. In any case, a big bull trend can begin with the version small trend. Sometimes the single bull trend bar can be the start of a trend. And sometimes a series of bull trend bars can be a start of a trend. Look at this. From this bar to that bar, no pullback. So it's about a 10 bar full micro channels On a higher time frame chart, this entire rally is a breakout. So if this is a 15 minute chart on the 60 minute chart, or a two hour chart, or a three hour chart, it would simply be one, two or three big bull bars closing down their highs. Sometimes a single bull bar can be the start of a breakout. Sometimes a series of bull bars can be the start of a breakout. All trends are in channels. This is a very Typeful channel. But this bull trend is in a channel, this is on the left, a bear channel. All reversals are breakouts. Here we have a small bull reversal and is it a breakout? Well, it is. It's a break above the bear trend line. So it's a break above the channel. And it's also a wedge bottom where you can say a double bottom with a failed breakout, which is a type of wedge problem. So every reversal is a breakout of something, even if it's not clear when you get follow through buying like this. I view this as a give up series of bars. The bears are giving up. What happens is you get bears who doubt the whole breakout will succeed and they sell, they sell more higher and at some point they conclude that they're going to lose money. So they give up. And this pair of bull bars, consecutive bull bars, gap below that bar, the high of this bar, this is probably the give up bar with the banished game uploaded shorts. And it's also probably where the bulls who are waiting for high probability. What you have bulls buying here and you have bears buying here and both are buying aggressively. The bears are desperate to get out of their losing trade before the loss becomes too big. And the bulls at this point realize the market has a high probability of going higher. So they're buying aggressively. And this is what followed. They created a big bull breakout. Give up bars. The bears finally giving up, taking your losses. And the bulls know the bears are doing that. And the bulls buy aggressively because they know if the bears are buying back their shorts, the bears are not going to sell again one or two bars later. They'll wait for at least several bars. So it's a high probability buy 60% or higher that there'll be at least some kind of a measured result, maybe a measured move based upon the height of this training range. It obviously much higher than that. But the context is good for the bulls and they have a good breakout and good follow through bar. Chances are 60%. We're going up for some kind of a measured view stocks. Here's Amazon daily chart of Amazon often have big gaps on the open. This day opened far below the low that day. You can see there just gaps in many different places on the chart. Every gap is a breakout and it can succeed or fail. So here we have a big gap down and it ultimately reverse up. Here we have a big gap down, ultimately reverse up. Here we have a small gap up, reverse down. So any gap like any other type of breakout can succeed or fail. And traders look at the price Action and try to determine what is more likely a successful breakout and a new trend or a tail breakout. On forex charts, gaps are much less common and they're in general not particularly important. Sometimes they are, but for the most part they're not. So a big gap down below yesterday's low, today's opens down here and that's yesterday's small, big gap down in the field. The stronger a breakout is, the more likely it's going to lead to a trend. Here we have a pair of small bull bars, not particularly strong. And then we have a bigger bull bar closing near as high. We have gaps this close above that high, this close above that high and this close way above this side. So the trend is getting stronger. And the entire three bars is also a breakout. This is a breakout. This is a breakout. This is another stronger breakout. And the three bars. Some computers look at the entire three bars as a breakout. Here's the follow through bar. The minimum that the bulls want to see is the absence of a bear body. And they got it. They got a bull body. That increases the chances that we'll go higher even if we pull back first. They got additional follow through buying here and here and then continued follow through buying for the next 20 bars. One big disadvantage of breakouts is the stop is usually far away. I said the probability of making money is high. If you're buying a strong breakout like this for any reason, why closes by the market probability of getting some kind of a measured move up is 60 or higher. So what's wrong with the trade? Well, the stop is far away. Anytime you have a high probability trade, you're going to have bad risk reward. Usually that means big risk. The stop is far away. Also, the market suddenly is moving quickly and unless you trade it a long time, it can be very difficult emotionally. And you think, my gosh, I don't know what to do. I'm afraid this is moving so fast, maybe it'll move just as fast back down. Traders get paralyzed by fear. One of the important things in this course that I talk about all the time is that you're always looking for reasons to trade. There's lots of trading taking place on every bar on every chart. But a lot of times you don't know what to do. Do I buy at the market? Well, it's good to have behaviors that are are fairly easy to execute. And here, this is a good buy, the close full trend. So as soon as you see a bull close, you can buy. If you did not buy that one, you see Another one buy. If you did not take those two and you see a third one, just hit buy the market and put your stop in the right place. Since your risk is big, you have to trade small. If you're starting out, you'll get this house. Giving me good advice, I can just buy these closes, put myself down here and 60% chance I'm going to get the measured move up. So if I buy here, here's my risk. 60% chance we're going higher. If I buy here, here's my risk. 60 chance we'll get to a measured move based upon this close every step of the way. If you buy here, 60 chance it will go for measurement. If you buy here, the breakout's even bigger. So now the target is even higher. If you buy here, the risk is bigger. It's a logical buy. Chances are the target now is even higher. It looks easy to do right, but it's hard to do emotionally. It takes a while to get used to it. And the most important thing is to trade the I don't care size. You trade small enough so that you truly do not care if you lose. I always talk about risk. Risk usually means price dollars. But a component of that can be time. If you feel rushed into making a decision and it interferes with your ability to make the decision, that is risk. So if you feel pressured, you think that the chance of making a bad decision is higher, that is risk. Now let's say you buy for any reason. Where do you exit? Well, as long as your premise is still valid, you can just keep holding. Some traders will exit and they'll just scalp and buy again, scalp, buy again and scalp. But most traders cannot get back in once they get out. So whenever you have a strong breakout, it's usually better just to put the appropriate stop down there and wait until the trend is no longer a trend, wait until your premise looks like it's no longer valid and then get up. I said you can buy for any reason. You can buy at the market. You can buy a bull breakout, you can buy a follow through bar, you can buy more follow through. You can buy with a limit order at the low of this bar, betting the reversal attempt will fail. You can buy with stops above these bars does not matter. But because the stop is far away, you have to trade small. And a strong bull trend has a high probability of continuing up. So the later you enter, the higher up you're being forced to buy. You always have to be thinking about your position size. You have to adjust it based upon your stock. If you're thinking also that hey, I'm gonna buy this pose and if it drops all the way down here, I'm going to buy more, then you have to do the math and pick a position size that's small enough so that if you buy and buy more lower and get stopped out, you do not lose more than on any other trade. Then profit target, high probability trade. All you need is a reward equal to one times your actual risk. Your initial risk is here. But if you bought here, the market kept going up. Your initial risk was just a tiny bit. Do you get out that tiny bit higher? No, because there's always a minimum. The Forex market, you never want to take less than a 10 pip profit on a 5 minute chart. And in the E Mini you never want to get out with less than a point. But again, when you have a 60% chance of a measured move up, I would not recommend scalping unless you're really good at getting back in. I would just buy and hold. In this video I talked about the importance of follow through after a breakout. If the follow through bar is in the same direction as the breakout bar, higher probability the trend will continue at least a little bit. Because trends are always trying to reverse, traders will bet that the reversals will fail. So if you have a bull trend and then a bear bar, bulls will buy that bear clothes. If you have a bear trend and bull bar, traders will sell that close. Finally, breakouts can be small. It can be as small as a single small bear bar or bull bar. And they can also be large. They can also be made up of many small bars. They come in many different types. I'm Al Brooks. Thank you for watching the Brooks Trading course. This is the second of eight videos on breakouts.
