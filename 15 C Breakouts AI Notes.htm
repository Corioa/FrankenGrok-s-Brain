</b><br>
<br>
Here's a day trading strategy based on Al Brooks' methodology as described in
the transcript:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Al Brooks-Inspired Price Action Trading Strategy for Day
Traders:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Key Concepts:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakouts and Pullbacks:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Flag:</b> In a bear trend, look for a series of
      bearish bars followed by a small bullish pullback. This setup suggests a
      potential continuation of the downtrend after the pullback.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Breakout:</b> After a bear flag, if the price
      breaks above the highest high of the flag, it indicates a possible
      reversal or significant counter-trend move.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading the Breakout:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry Points:</b></li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bearish Setup:</b> Sell below the low of the previous
       bearish bar in a bear flag setup, with a stop just above the high of
       that bar.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bullish Setup:</b> Buy above the high of a breakout
       bar following a bear flag or after a significant bullish bar in a
       downtrend, with a stop just below the low of the breakout bar.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Loss:</b> Place stops just beyond the opposite
      side of the key price levels (high or low of significant bars).</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Targets:</b></li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>First Leg:</b> Aim for a move equal to or slightly
       less than the height of the flag or channel.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Second Leg:</b> If there's a pullback after the first
       leg, look for another move in the same direction, often with the same
       amplitude or more if momentum continues.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reading Price Action:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation:</b> In a trend, smaller pullbacks
      or inside bars are often buying opportunities for the trend direction.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reversal Signs:</b> Look for failed breakouts or weak
      follow-through bars after a breakout. If the market reacts poorly to a
      breakout, it might indicate a trap or a potential reversal.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Ranges:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Scalping:</b> In a trading range, buy at the lower
      third and sell at the upper third of the range, expecting the breakout to
      fail (80% rule).</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Persistence:</b> After 20 or more bars in a
      range, both bull and bear breakouts have similar probabilities, but
      initial breakouts usually fail. Wait for confirmation or consider not
      trading until a clear trend emerges post-breakout.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Momentum and Follow-Through:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strong Breakout:</b> A breakout with significant
      follow-through (multiple bars in the direction of the breakout without
      significant pullbacks) suggests a continuation. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Weak Breakout:</b> If the breakout bar has a long tail
      or no follow-through, be cautious as it might not lead to a sustained
      move.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy in Action:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bearish Example:</b> </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Spot a bear flag in a downtrend. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Sell short below the low of the last bear bar in the
      flag.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Stop loss above the high of the flag.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Look for a second leg down if there's a small pullback.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bullish Example:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Identify a bull breakout from a bear flag or a double
      bottom. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Enter long above the high of the breakout bar.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Place stop loss below the low of the breakout bar or the
      last significant low in the pattern.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Expect at least a second leg up if the initial move has
      good follow-through.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This strategy leverages Al Brooks' focus on price action,
emphasizing the importance of context (trend vs. range), breakout strength, and
the reaction of subsequent bars to determine trade entries, exits, and
expectations for market movement. Remember, trading always involves risk, and
this strategy should be tested in a demo environment before applying it with
real capital.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Exit
Plan:&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>in the context of this video, in as many words as you
think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader EXITS a
position</i><br>
<br>
In the video transcript provided, Al Brooks discusses several nuanced exit
strategies for trading positions, particularly focusing on breakouts,
pullbacks, and trading ranges. Here's a detailed breakdown of how he recommends
traders exit their positions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting Breakouts:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quick Exit for Scalps:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>For Scalping:</b> If you're trading a breakout as a
      scalp, Brooks suggests exiting quickly. This means if you buy on a
      breakout and the market starts to pull back, you might exit at a 3 to 4
      tick pullback or aim to exit at breakeven if the market allows,
      especially if the initial move lacks strength or follow-through. The idea
      here is to minimize risk when the trade doesn't go as planned.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Manual Exits:</b> Brooks implies that if the market
      starts moving against your scalp trade, you might manually exit rather
      than waiting for your stop to be hit, especially if you see the
      probability of success diminishing.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Swing Trading Exits:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Holding for Pullbacks:</b> For swing trades, Brooks
      advises traders to allow for pullbacks. If the breakout is part of a
      swing trade, the trader should hold as long as the market action
      validates the trade premise. For example, in a bull breakout, hold as
      long as pullbacks do not breach the most recent breakout low.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting on Reversal Signals:</b> If a strong reversal
      signal appears before the price falls below a significant low (in a
      bullish scenario), exit the trade. This could be a bear bar with a strong
      close or other signs of momentum shift.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting After Second Leg:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Second Leg Confirmation:</b> Brooks notes that after a
      successful breakout, there's often a second leg in the same direction. If
      this second leg confirms the trend with good follow-through, traders
      might consider holding for this move. However, if the second leg doesn't
      meet expectations (e.g., lacks strength or has weak follow-through),
      exiting at or near the high of this leg might be wise.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting in Trading Ranges:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Scalping Within Ranges:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Sell High, Buy Low:</b> In a trading range, Brooks
      recommends taking profits on scalps by selling at the top third of the
      range and buying at the bottom third. This approach anticipates that
      breakouts will fail, aligning with his &quot;80% rule&quot; where 80% of
      breakouts in a trading range do not succeed.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Using Limit Orders:</b> Place limit orders to sell at
      the high of the range or buy at the low for small, quick profits, knowing
      that the market will likely revert to the mean within the range.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exit on Breakout Failure:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Failed Breakout Exits:</b> If you've entered on a
      breakout within a range and it fails (i.e., the price reverses back into
      the range), use this opportunity to exit. This could mean selling if you
      went long on a failed bull breakout or buying back if you shorted on a
      failed bear breakout.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>General Exit Principles:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management:</b> Brooks emphasizes exiting trades
     when the risk-reward ratio turns unfavorable, especially if the stop loss
     becomes too distant from the entry, indicating increased risk without
     proportional reward potential.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Taking:</b> Exits are also about taking profits,
     especially when the market moves in your favor but starts showing signs of
     reversing or when you've achieved a significant part of your profit
     target.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Emotional and Algorithmic Exits:</b> He mentions that
     both human traders and algorithmic systems might choose to exit when stops
     are too far, which often leads to pullbacks as traders take profits to
     reduce risk exposure.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Adapting to Market Dynamics:</b> Brooks suggests that
     sometimes, the market's behavior post-entry can dictate an exit. If the
     market does not behave as expected, such as not providing follow-through
     or showing signs of an exhaustion gap, this might be a signal to exit or
     at least scale out of the position.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, Brooks' exit strategies are about reading the
market's price action, managing risk, and adapting to how the trade evolves
after entry. His approach combines technical analysis with an understanding of
trader psychology, both of the trader and the market participants at large.</p>

Executive Summary:</b><br>
<br>
In this video, Al Brooks delves into the nuances of trading breakouts, focusing
on a specific pattern known as the bear flag. He explains that a strong
breakout often leads to at least a second leg in the direction of the breakout,
which is crucial for traders to recognize for strategic entries and exits. </a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks starts by identifying a bear flag within a downtrend,
where traders expect a continuation downwards. However, he discusses scenarios
where the market unexpectedly breaks out to the upside, leading to trapped
traders (bears trapped in losing shorts, bulls not buying into a
low-probability bull breakout). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He emphasizes the importance of follow-through after
breakouts. A weak follow-through might indicate a failure or a trap, whereas
strong follow-through can confirm the breakout's validity. For example, after a
bullish breakout from a bear flag, if there's significant bullish continuation,
it's a signal for continued upward movement, often aiming for at least a second
leg up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks also discusses trading within ranges, where he
applies his &quot;80% rule&quot; stating that 80% of breakouts fail in a
trading range. Here, he advocates for scalping strategies, buying low and
selling high within the established range, anticipating that breakouts will not
sustain. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The video covers how to manage trades post-entry,
particularly focusing on when to take profits or exit trades. Brooks talks
about recognizing when a breakout lacks strength for further continuation,
suggesting traders might exit or take profits at these points. He also mentions
the psychological aspects of trading where both human and algorithmic traders
might close positions as stops become too distant, leading to market pullbacks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, Brooks teaches traders to read market context,
manage risk, and adjust their strategies based on real-time price action,
focusing on how breakouts can either be the beginning of a significant move or
a potential trap requiring a swift exit strategy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks
Speaks:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Look through the transcript at the references to the
specific examples Brooks makes, and talk about what he talks about, how it
relates to the context of the whole video, using specific quotations from
Brooks to make your points, both specific to his point or in a broader
context.&quot;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In Al Brooks' video on breakouts, he provides several specific examples to
illustrate key concepts related to price action, breakout strength, and trader
psychology. Here's how these examples relate to the broader context of the
video:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Flag and Bull Breakout:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks uses an example of a bear flag to discuss expected
market behavior:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;Look at this chart here we have a
     series of bear bars. It's a bear flag. Odds are the breakout will be to
     the downside.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> This sets up his explanation of traditional
breakout expectations. However, he then pivots to what happens when these
expectations are subverted, leading to:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;They expected a bear breakout and
     instead they got a bull breakout. So traders are trapped in and out.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context:</b> This highlights the importance of
flexibility in trading. Brooks uses this to explain how traders can be
&quot;trapped&quot; in positions, emphasizing the need for quick response to
unexpected market moves, which is a recurring theme throughout the video about
managing risk and expectations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Follow-Through and Second Leg:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks discusses the significance of follow-through after a
breakout:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;As I said, sometimes you get a third,
     fourth or fifth leg up, but the minimum goal is the second leg up.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> He explains that a breakout isn't just about
the initial move but what follows. A strong follow-through confirms the
breakout's validity, which is crucial for deciding whether to hold or exit a
trade.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;Strong enough breakout here. First leg
     up, second leg up has strong breakout and decent follow through.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context:</b> This reinforces the concept of
momentum in trading. Brooks is teaching traders to look for signs that the
market will continue in the breakout direction, which is vital for both entry
and exit strategies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Ranges and Breakout Failures:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks provides insight into trading within ranges:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;Clearly a trading range. Everyone
     knows I always talk about my 80 rule. 80% of the time when the market's in
     a trading range, strong breakouts fail or all breakouts fail, no matter
     how strong.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> Here, he's directly addressing the
often-ignored aspect of breakouts - their failure rate in trading ranges. This
is pivotal for understanding when not to trade or to trade with caution.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;Traders will bet against breakouts.
     They'll sell bull closes near the top, they'll buy air closes near the
     bottom, they'll buy reversals up near the bottom, they'll sell reversals
     down near the top and they scout.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context:</b> This quote illustrates trading
psychology and strategy within a range, where the goal is not to trade
breakouts but to scalp within the range, anticipating that the market will
revert to its mean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting Trades and Managing Risk:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks often refers to exits and risk management through
examples:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;If you're a bull and you've got long
     right here, as the market fell below that low, what do you do at this
     point? You know, it's probably a measuring gap that we're going lower. So
     you got to sell out of your logs.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> This example underlines the necessity of
recognizing when a trade's premise has failed. It's about adapting to new
market information, which aligns with the video's theme of dynamic trading
strategy adjustment.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;So the probability is you're falling
     more. Let's say you sold anywhere in here and you say, gosh, my stop is
     way up there. I don't want to risk that much.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context:</b> Brooks is discussing how to manage
risk when the market moves against your position, highlighting the emotional
and strategic components of deciding when to exit to protect capital.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' use of specific examples throughout the video serves
not only to clarify concepts like breakouts, follow-through, and trading within
ranges but also to teach traders how to adapt to market conditions, manage
expectations, and handle risk. His approach combines technical analysis with
practical trading psychology, making his lessons applicable in real trading
scenarios where market behavior can often defy initial expectations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks
Speaks Specifically:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Could you please identify and provide quotations from Al
Brooks that elucidate the trading calculations and behaviors of market
participants, particularly those that describe specific market conditions or
actions, akin to statements like &quot;when the market comes to the middle 1/3
of the channel, bulls buy again&quot;?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
<br>
Here are several quotations from Al Brooks in the transcript that elucidate
trading calculations and behaviors of market participants, focusing on market
conditions or actions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Trading Within Channels:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;When a range is this tight, I think
      most traders should not trade. This is the dollar versus the yen bulls
      binding to the bottom, confident the bear breakout will fail. Bears
      selling the top, confident the bull breakout will fail.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This statement describes how traders behave within a tight
trading range, where both bulls and bears trade with confidence in the failure
of breakouts, buying low and selling high within the range.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=2 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Breakouts and Follow-Through:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;But close above the middle of the bar
      and a Second close above the trading range probability is measuring gap,
      not exhaustion gap. So probably going up for at least measured move based
      on the height of this range.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here, Brooks outlines how traders assess the strength of a
breakout. If there's a close above the middle of a bar and further confirmation
with another close above the trading range, it's likely a measuring gap,
suggesting the market will move further in that direction.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=3 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Pullbacks and Second Legs:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;So traders will sell below the prior
      bar. They'll sell with a stop below that bar. They'll sell at the market
      betting that the bull reversal attempt will fail.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This describes the behavior of traders in a bear market,
expecting a continuation after a small pullback (bear flag), with specific
actions on where to enter and place stops.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=4 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Trading Ranges and Scalping:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;Traders will bet against breakouts.
      They'll sell bull closes near the top, they'll buy air closes near the
      bottom, they'll buy reversals up near the bottom, they'll sell reversals
      down near the top and they scout. They take quick profits because they
      know the odds are breakouts will not be successful.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks explains the strategy of scalping within a trading
range, where traders aim to make small profits by betting against breakouts,
buying at the bottom third, and selling at the top third of the range.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=5 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Market Sentiment and Trapped Traders:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;Bears are trapped in. They've been
      selling here, betting on a second leg down and bulls were trapped out. It
      was a low probability buy.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quote discusses how market participants can get trapped
by unexpected market moves, influencing their subsequent trading behaviors,
either by exiting or waiting for better opportunities.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=6 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Risk Management and Position Exits:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;So the probability is you're falling
      more. Let's say you sold anywhere in here and you say, gosh, my stop is
      way up there. I don't want to risk that much.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks talks about how traders manage risk when their stop
loss becomes too far from their entry, often leading to exiting trades or
taking partial profits to reduce exposure.</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=7 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Trend Continuation and Pullback Buying:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote:</b> &quot;Traders saw this. They wanted to buy
      any pullback. They placed a limit order to buy at the low of this bar did
      not get filled. They placed a limit order to buy at the low of this bar
      did not get filled.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This illustrates how traders in a bull trend look to buy on
pullbacks, using limit orders to enter at perceived value areas, showing their
anticipation of trend continuation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These quotes encapsulate Brooks' insights into how market
participants react to various market conditions, providing a nuanced view of
trading psychology, strategy adjustment, and risk management based on price
action.</p>

V. Strategy by Brooks in the Context of Video</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I enjoyed what you wrote with what brook says about
trading, in the context of this video. Do you think you could use Brooks'
examples, statements, and quips, to elucidate a contrast of his philosophy
(contrast, list, whatever) between tactics and strategy in regards to the
content of this video? Frame it in the format of the following but you are now
referring to the present video and not the content of the following example,
despite similarities.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'><br>
</span></u></b>Here's a structured comparison between tactics and strategy as
discussed by Al Brooks in the context of the video on breakouts:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tactics:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Breakout Entry Points:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Tactic: Selling short below the low of a bearish bar in a
      bear flag or buying long above the high of a bullish breakout bar.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Example: &quot;So traders will sell below the prior bar.
      They'll sell with a stop below that bar.&quot; This tactic is about
      pinpointing exact entry points based on recent price action.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Stop Loss Placement:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Tactic: Placing stops just beyond the opposite side of
      key price levels to manage risk.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Statement: &quot;My risk is not big. I sell this close. I
      risk to just above this bar.&quot; This highlights a tactical approach to
      risk management where the stop is strategically placed for optimal risk
      control.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Exiting on Follow-Through:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Tactic: Exiting trades when there's a lack of
      follow-through or when the market shows signs of reversal.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Insight: &quot;If you have a bear trend and then a small
      pullback like this, a bear flag, foreign breakout. Traders expected the
      opposite.&quot; Here, the tactic involves exiting if the market doesn't
      behave as expected post-breakout.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Scalping in Trading Ranges:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Tactic: Taking quick, small profits by buying at the
      lower third and selling at the upper third of a trading range.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Quotation: &quot;Traders will bet against breakouts.
      They'll sell bull closes near the top, they'll buy air closes near the
      bottom.&quot; This reflects a tactic of capitalizing on range-bound
      market behavior.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Anticipating Traps:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Tactic: Recognizing when a breakout might be a trap and
      adjusting positions accordingly.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Example: &quot;Bears are trapped in. They've been selling
      here, betting on a second leg down.&quot; This tactic involves
      understanding when to exit or reverse positions based on unexpected
      market moves.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strategy:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Understanding Breakout Dynamics:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Strategy: Recognizing that not all breakouts lead to
      sustained moves, especially within trading ranges.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Philosophy: &quot;80% of the time when the market's in a
      trading range, strong breakouts fail or all breakouts fail, no matter how
      strong.&quot; This strategy shapes how traders view potential breakouts
      in different market contexts.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trend and Counter-Trend Analysis:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Strategy: Deciphering whether the market is in a trend or
      a range to adjust trading approach.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Insight: &quot;Every attempt to rally the bears see all
      of these attempts as Bear Flight.&quot; This strategy involves
      interpreting market movements in the context of the prevailing trend or
      range.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Probability and Risk Management:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Strategy: Trading based on the probability of market
      continuation versus reversal, and managing risk accordingly.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Quotation: &quot;In any trade where one side has low
      probability, that side usually also has high risk reward.&quot; Here,
      Brooks outlines a strategy of trading with an eye on risk-reward ratios
      based on market probabilities.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Psychological Preparation:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Strategy: Preparing for emotional responses to market
      movements, especially in scenarios of trapped positions.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks' Rule: &quot;Remember, beers have trapped into
      shorts and at some point they conclude it's not going down. I gotta
      buy.&quot; This strategy involves readiness for quick adaptation to
      market psychology.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Market Structure Interpretation:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Strategy: Viewing market movements as part of larger
      patterns like flags, channels, and trends to forecast future price
      action.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Example: &quot;We have a bear flag. We have a bull
      breakout above the bear flag.&quot; This strategy emphasizes
      understanding how current price action fits into broader market
      structures.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Contrast:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Tactics in Brooks' video are about the immediate,
     practical steps traders take in response to specific price actions, like
     entering, adjusting stops, or exiting trades based on bar-by-bar analysis.
     They are the &quot;how&quot; of trading in real-time scenarios.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Strategy, on the other hand, involves the overarching
     approach to trading, focusing on understanding market behavior over time,
     recognizing patterns, and anticipating market movements based on
     historical tendencies and probabilities. This is the &quot;why&quot;
     behind choosing certain tactics, providing a framework for decision-making
     in various market conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, while tactics are the immediate actions taken in
response to market signals, Brooks' strategy in this video educates traders on
the underlying principles that dictate when and why these tactics should be
applied, ensuring they are in sync with the market's broader narrative and
behavioral patterns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Overview</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The &quot;15 C Breakouts&quot; educational presentation
meeting focused on the essential characteristics and strategies surrounding
trading breakouts. It covered the nuances of strong breakouts, emphasizing the
importance of second legs and the risks involved with bear flags, which can
lead to downside breakouts and trap traders. Participants learned about
breakout patterns, follow-through potential, and the challenges of trading
ranges, noting that 80% of breakouts in these scenarios fail. The discussion
highlighted market dynamics, including how trader behavior influences entry and
exit decisions, the tendency for profit-taking to cause pullbacks, and the
critical assessment traders perform after brief pullbacks. Overall, the meeting
provided valuable insights into maximizing trading success through a deeper

<b><br>
Overlap Between Summaries:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. Emphasis on Strong Breakouts:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Both summaries highlight Brooks' point that &quot;strong
     breakouts usually have at least a second leg.&quot; This is central to
     understanding breakout trading, as Brooks states, &quot;As I said,
     sometimes you get a third, fourth or fifth leg up, but the minimum goal is
     the second leg up.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Bear Flags and Trapped Traders:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>We both mention how bear flags can lead to downside
     breakouts and how traders can get trapped, aligning with Brooks' quote,
     &quot;They expected a bear breakout and instead they got a bull breakout.
     So traders are trapped in and out.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Trading Ranges and Breakout Failures:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The 80% rule regarding breakout failures in trading ranges
     is covered by both summaries, with Brooks explicitly stating, &quot;80% of
     the time when the market's in a trading range, strong breakouts fail or
     all breakouts fail, no matter how strong.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4. Market Dynamics and Trader Behavior:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Both summaries discuss how traders react to market
     conditions like pullbacks and profit-taking, which Brooks explains with,
     &quot;So the probability is you're falling more. Let's say you sold
     anywhere in here and you say, gosh, my stop is way up there. I don't want
     to risk that much.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Differences and Salient Points:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. Detailed Explanations vs. Broad Overview:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>My summary delves into more detailed examples and
     explanations of different scenarios (e.g., specific behaviors after
     pullbacks, how to manage trades post-entry), whereas Fireflies.ai's
     summary provides a broader, segmented overview of topics discussed without
     as much depth on market participant behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Focus on Price Action and Follow-Through:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>I focus more on the specifics of price action and
     follow-through, which Brooks emphasizes as critical for assessing the
     validity of a breakout. For example, &quot;But close above the middle of
     the bar and a Second close above the trading range probability is
     measuring gap, not exhaustion gap.&quot; This detail is somewhat glossed
     over in the Fireflies summary.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Risk Management and Exit Strategies:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>My summary includes more on how Brooks advises exiting
     trades, particularly around risk management, with quotes like, &quot;If
     you're a bull and you've got long right here, as the market fell below
     that low, what do you do at this point? You know, it's probably a
     measuring gap that we're going lower. So you got to sell out of your
     logs.&quot; Fireflies.ai's summary, while touching on risk-reward, lacks
     this specific guidance.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4. Psychological Aspects of Trading:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>I expand on the psychological elements of trading, which
     Brooks often refers to, like the concept of traders being
     &quot;trapped&quot; and how this influences trading decisions.
     Fireflies.ai's summary mentions this but doesn't dive into the
     implications for strategy as deeply.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5. Time Frame Considerations:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Fireflies.ai notes &quot;Tight channels are often
     breakouts on higher time frame charts,&quot; which I similarly acknowledge
     but expand upon by discussing how traders might interpret different bar
     patterns on various time frames for better decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What's Salient to Focus On:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Second Legs:</b> Brooks' emphasis on expecting and
     trading for a second leg after a breakout is fundamental, as it directly
     ties into risk/reward assessments.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trader Psychology:</b> Understanding how traders get
     trapped or react to market moves (like profit-taking causing pullbacks) is
     crucial for anticipating market movements.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Ranges:</b> The 80% breakout failure rule in
     ranges is vital for traders to understand when to trade conservatively or
     avoid trading altogether.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management:</b> Brooks' insights on where to place
     stops and how to exit trades based on price action, not just entry points,
     are key for managing trades effectively.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, while both summaries capture the essence of
Brooks' teachings, mine provides a deeper dive into the tactical and
psychological aspects of trading, which are pivotal for applying Brooks'
methodology in real-world scenarios.</p>

topic(s) you are focusing on. Additionally, speculate on what Al Brooks might

<p class=MsoNormal><b><br>
Chosen Indicator:</b> Price Action itself (specifically, candlestick patterns)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Important/Featured Topic:</b> Breakouts, follow-through,
and the psychology of trading within ranges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How Price Action (Candlestick Patterns) Works:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Price action trading involves analyzing the movement of
price as depicted by candlestick patterns to make trading decisions. Here's how
it relates to Brooks' teachings:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Candlestick Patterns:</b> These include patterns like
     doji, hammers, engulfing patterns, etc., which signal potential reversals
     or continuations.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bar-by-Bar Analysis:</b> Examining each bar or candle
     to understand market sentiment, momentum, and potential future movements.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Interpretation in the Context of Breakouts:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Confirmation:</b> A breakout is confirmed by
     the formation of significant candlestick patterns. For example, a strong
     bullish bar closing near its high after breaking a resistance level shows
     conviction for a breakout, which is central to Brooks' strategy. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Follow-Through:</b> Brooks emphasizes looking for bars
     that continue in the direction of the breakout. After a breakout, if
     subsequent candles maintain the momentum with large bodies or close
     strongly in the direction of the trend, it indicates follow-through.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Ranges:</b> Within ranges, price action can
     reveal where traders are buying or selling. Patterns like inside bars or
     small-bodied candles near the range's edges can signal impending breakouts
     or continuations of the range.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Aiding Day Trading Decisions:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry Points:</b> Traders might enter trades on the
     close of a breakout candlestick that shows strong directional intent. If a
     bullish candle breaks above resistance with a significant body, it could
     be an entry point for a long position.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exit Points:</b> A reversal pattern like a bearish
     engulfing or a series of small-bodied candles after a breakout might
     suggest an exit, as these could indicate the breakout's momentum is
     waning.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trade Management:</b> Understanding price action helps
     in setting stops just beyond significant highs or lows of recent bars or
     patterns, aligning with Brooks' risk management philosophy.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Speculation on Al Brooks' Commentary:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>On Pure Price Action:</b> Brooks might say, &quot;Every
     bar tells a story. You don't need fancy indicators; just watch the bars. A
     breakout with a strong close, no tail on top, that's the market screaming
     its direction. But if you see a doji or a small body candle after your breakout,
     be wary; that's the market whispering doubts.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Follow-Through:</b> He'd likely emphasize,
     &quot;Follow-through is everything. One bar isn't enough. You need to see
     at least two, three, maybe more, confirming the direction. If you break
     out but the next bars are all over the place, that's not follow-through;
     that's confusion.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Ranges:</b> For trading within ranges, Brooks
     might comment, &quot;In a range, every candle is a potential scalp. Look
     for those small candles, the inside bars. They're telling you the market's
     taking a breath. But don't get caught in the breakout trap; most will fail.
     Wait for price to tell you it's serious.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' approach is deeply rooted in reading the market's
narrative through the price action itself, focusing on the psychology behind
each bar and how it interacts with previous price movements. He would likely
caution against relying too heavily on any single pattern without considering
the broader context, advocating for a holistic understanding of market dynamics
as depicted by the candles on the chart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:107%'>Transcript
for Video</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm going to be talking about one of the important
characteristics of a strong breakout and that is that there usually is at least
a second light.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Look at this chart here we have a series of bear bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Odds are the breakout will be to the downside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So traders will sell below the prior bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They'll sell with a stop below that bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They'll sell at the market betting that the bull reversal
attempt will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have a bear trend and then a small pullback like
this, a bear flag, foreign breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders expected the opposite.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They expected a bear breakout and instead they got a bull
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So traders are trapped in and out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bears are trapped in.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They've been selling here, betting on a second leg down and
bulls were trapped out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a low probability buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>01:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So they did not buy above the highs of these bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And look at the bull bodies, smaller, non existent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So they were not even buying closes yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We got the bull breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bears are trapped into a bad trade.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bulls are trapped out of a good rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both are hoping for any kind of a pullback to buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bears want to pull back so they can buy back.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're losing shorts with a smaller loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls want a pullback because they see this as a
surprise, a low probability event.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They know they're attract traders.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They expect the market to go higher, least a little
bit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So they're and we got a second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The surprise means low probability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're getting a full breakout above a bear flag and it's a
pretty weak looking rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this is a pretty good bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>02:27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The odds were that the market was going to break to the
downside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In any trade where one side has low probability, that side
usually also has high risk reward.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls had a low probability bet that we get the bull
breakout because it's a low probability bet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has good risk reward and that means either small risk or
big reward.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Big reward usually means at least a second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many bulls will not buy here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They'll wait until the market breaks above some kind of a
major lower high, like for example, live that far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And again, as I said, the bears were selling all of these
bars betting on a resumption of the bear trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And they even sold early on in this bar betting that it
would be like these and the bulls would fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we get a bear breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>03:31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some bears will even sell this close, betting that the bulls
need one more bar and chances are reversals fail and the bulls will not get
their one more bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you'll get some bears not only selling as this bar
formed, some will wait for the close and say I got trapped bulls thinking that
they're going to get a successful breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore I'm going to sell this stronghold close betting
that the bulls will not get good follow through.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My risk is not big.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sell this close.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I risk to just above this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's a reasonable trade.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm risking very little at this point.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The probability is that the market is going higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But some bears will take that short foreigners.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a beer channel and we got a bull breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About the beer channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>04:33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a bull breakout above the bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And now we have a major lower high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I say that let's just assume that we're in a beer trend and
pull back.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's a major lower high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strong breakout to a new low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And now we have a breakout above that major lower
high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a pair of consecutive good bull bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some bulls will buy the close of this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other bulls will buy on a stop above.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their bears will buy on a stop above here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some bulls will say, well, it's consecutive bull bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But only one bar is breaking above a major lower high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I need one more full body.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And as small as this bull body is, that is enough for
traders to believe the probability is high that we're going to go up
higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>05:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So even though big tail on top, small bull body, it's a bull
body and not a bare body.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is good follow through buying and it increases the
probability that the market will go higher for some bulls.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the breakout of a bear channel and a bear flag for
other bulls, this is a more important breakout because it went above a major
lower high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some bulls will see this as the follow through from that
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other bulls will see this as the follow through from this
two bar break up above this lower high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both are high probability bias.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is what happened.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And pullback, sideways pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We could not even pull back below the low of the prior
bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders were so eager to buy both bulls and bears.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>06:11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember, beers have trapped into shorts and at some point
they conclude it's not going down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I gotta buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the bears give up and bulls are trapped out of logs and they
decide at some point that it's not going down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I better start buying with stops.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe above the highs of these bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This bar or is this bar goes up above this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders decide that the price is wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No one wants to sell here and has to go up higher to find
where there might be sellers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I call this a pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A pullback is any pause in a bull trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Technically, this is a pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this bar fell below that bar as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this is a type of pullback as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's an II bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a bull trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>07:07</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're always in long and went sideways in a pair of inside
bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Look at the low of this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders saw this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They wanted to buy any pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They placed a limit order to buy at the low of this bar did
not get filled.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They placed a limit order to buy at the low of this bar did
not get filled.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So all of those traders who were so eager to buy a pullback
are not getting into the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of them are not getting filled with their limit
orders.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And at some point they say, it's going up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm just going to buy the market and start to get that
second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So leg one pullback, leg two.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After any kind of breakout with follow through, the minimum
goal is the second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>07:56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I said, sometimes you get a third, fourth or fifth leg
up, but the minimum goal is the second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We got a bull breakout and now we're starting to form a
channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A tight channel like this is a breakout on a higher time
frame chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this is still a strong bull trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, we have a second leg up, but it's probably continuing
higher because a tight channel like this is usually a breakout on a higher time
frame chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So yes, two legs up, one pullback two on a higher time frame
chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is still part of leg one and we don't know where leg
one ends.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever you do have a leg one move, you always think about,
well, maybe we'll get a leg one, leg two move.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe leg one pull back and then leg two measured move
up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>08:51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strong enough breakout here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First leg up, second leg up has strong breakout and decent
follow through.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there may be a second leg up after this second leg
up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In other words, the third leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it's a strong enough breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More traders are trapped, bulls are trapped out, beers are
trapped in.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chances are we're going up at least a little bit more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another strong breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably strong enough for at least the second leg up
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pull back, second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes breakouts are a single bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes they're 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes you have one breakout and then a second leg up and
that's the end of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You enter A trading range or even a bear trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes you get a series of breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breakout, Pullback, Breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>09:48</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now sometimes you can get a very strong second leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have an okay beer breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any trend bar is a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any series of trend bars is a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bars closing near their lows, having decent sized bodies
increase the probability that the first pullback will be sold and you get a
second leg down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And sometimes the second leg down is very strong, especially
if it's in a trading range and it becomes a second leg trap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So if this were a trading range or a broad bull channel and
I see a strong second leg down like that, I'm assuming it's a second leg trap
and it's the end of the move and not a measuring gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So more likely an exhaustion gap and the gap between this
close and that low will close and the market would either go sideways or even
up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10:38</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stronger breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is it strong enough so that the odds are there'll be at
least a second leg?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, second leg does not necessarily mean second leg to a
new low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes you get a breakout and the second leg does not
fall below the low of the first leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This might be the second one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This might be the second leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This might be the second leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes the second leg down can form a higher level second
leg down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It can be simply a single bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we got a bull breakout of a bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we've got either one leg up, pull back, two legs up, and
we got a bull breakout above a double top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You say one leg up, two legs up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it could be a large bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In any case, we got a double top bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11:25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have a decent bull breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But look at the follow through.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A terrible follow through bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you get disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bulls who bought that close and now they're hoping for the
market to get back to that close so they can sell out of their launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's what they did here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of bulls who bought this close or bought the breakout decided,
this is disappointing, I better get out, break even.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm time to place a limit order to sell on that close.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when it got back to the close, they sold strong enough,
full breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The market's probably not going to go straight down strong
enough, full breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there will be some buyers on a reversal attempt and we'll
get a second leg up again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12:05</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes the second leg up does not get above the top of
the first leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And sometimes the second leg up is simply a single bar
wedge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fair Flag tried to get a bear breakout and it reversed up
and we got a bull breakdown double top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instead of a downside breakout, we got a bull
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, I got a problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's basically an I, I or an III pattern micro double
top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is a possible micro double top and a failed
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Higher probability to sell below this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sitting on a failed bull breakout, the bulls tried to get up
here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They had a second bar up here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then this bar tells me that a lot of the bulls who
bought here use this bar to get out, break even, and the bulls are giving
up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12:56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we got a micro double top and a failed breakout above the
wedge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fair flag Bulls will give up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here the bulls did give up and bear still short.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Either below this, far below these three bars or below this
bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is where traders mostly sold it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of times it's not clear and a lot of times you need to
wait and you need more bars to get clarity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Different computers will use different counts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So strong bull breakout, pretty bad follow through, but
still strong enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We'll break out for a second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is this the second leg up?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some computers will say, this is it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We went sideways.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're trying to go up again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is this the second leg up Again, some computers will say
that's the second leg up and we fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13:47</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others will say this is the second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others will wait and say we'll probably get an even stronger
second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here we did get an obvious second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So at this point, maybe this is the second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>@ this point, maybe it's the second leg up to a micro double
top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bears are trying to break to the downside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bear breakout that follows through.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From these two bars, we got a clear second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>@ this point we have a big bold breakout bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clearly a second leg up comparable in strength than
this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe leg one, pullback leg two.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then terrible follow through.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Minimum requirement has been met.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strong enough to get a second leg up, we got a second leg
up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strong enough to get a measured move up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We got leg one, pullback leg two.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14:33</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the bulls are satisfied.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They got their goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then we got this bad policy bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of shades will sell that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Betting that we have the second leg up, some traders will
say, well, isn't this strong enough for another second leg up?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It might be, but I certainly would not buy at the low of
this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only thing I would do with a little this part is either
get out of lungs or go short.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bear breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a Beer breakout here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably second leg down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This might be the second leg down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the Euro versus the $60 minute chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe this breakout is strong enough so that we get even
further down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe because this channel is so tight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don't know if it's a micro channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This might be a little pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15:16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But in any case, it's a pretty tight beer channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a breakout on a higher time frame chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So any pullback that we get probably will be followed by a
second leg down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So strong bear breakdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>60% chance of the second leg down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>40% chance it'll fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we will reverse up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Big bear bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consecutive bear bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls are giving up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So all the bulls who are buying here, hoping for a reversal,
maybe higher low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Major trend reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They gave up here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a minor reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, the first breakup above a type here channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably the best the bulls get is a bull leg that becomes a
bear flag here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not enough bars for a major reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So again, minor reversal, which means odds are we're going
lower.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here, both bulls and bears sold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls sold out of their longs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16:15</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Giving up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And a beer sold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bidding on resumption.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trend down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Same true here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Very strong bear breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Possibly an exhaustive end of the move.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever you have a strong bear breakout occurring 20 or
more bars into a trend, it's more likely to be an exhaustion gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's what we have here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The biggest pair of bear bars in the entire sell off
occurring maybe 50 bars into the trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More likely exhaustion gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gap between this close and this low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This close and that low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This close and that low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chances are we're going to go to the top of the cell climax
or at least a little bit above it, and you get two legs off.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One pullback two.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But cell climax does not mean reversal of the bull
trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17:04</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It just means the bears are exhausted and they'll wait five
or ten or more bars before they're willing to sell again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They usually wait until the market tests the top of the cell
climax.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It tried to break above it here, here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Kept failing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then at some point here, everyone sold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls gave up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the beer sold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another big cell climax.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consecutive cell CL here, here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bigger here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even bigger still.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So probably we'll get some kind of significant bounce
soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each one of these bear breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bulls are giving up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls who are hoping for a bomber.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're giving up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bulls tried to bottom here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Minor tried to bottom here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Minor tried to bottom here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe a higher low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Major trend reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Major trend Reversal probably not.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not enough buying pressure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So even this is probably a minor higher low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18:07</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And every one of the reversal attempts failed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of times when you're in a channel and the market
becomes always in long like it probably was somewhere here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's probably a broad bear channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Broad bear channels typically have times within the channel
that market is always in long.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the market continues to make lower highs and lower
lows.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a test of the top of this final Bear Leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It became a double top Bear Flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's the neckline.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Work below the neckline.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pretty impressive Cell Climax.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably an exhaustive Cell Climax.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we got to the top of the Cell Climax.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then here we have another even stronger Cell Climax, an
even bigger bare bar than any of the bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You pass 100 bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18:53</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the odds are it's going to be a cell climax, an
exhaustion gap rather than a measuring gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it's possible that we get a measurement down from
there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More likely the gap will close by close.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Typically you get to the top of the Cell Climax bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You get to the top of the cell Climb X leg, and then you
enter a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes you get Bull Gold Channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bear Flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Full channel or trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bear Flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stronger full channel, but still Bear Flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Little Triangle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bear Flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Got a Bull Breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then a Bear Breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every attempt to rally the bears see all of these attempts
as Bear Flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so they're looking to sell a Bear Breakout below the
Bear Flag so they can sell the stops on the reversal back down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19:48</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some bears will sell above bull bars betting that the
reversal of this minor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But bears are selling all the way up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's why the rallies look so weak.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where are the consecutive Big Bull Trend bars?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They do not exist because the bulls are not strong
enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And all of these reversals are minor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Minor means at best, a bull leg in a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the odds are that we'll have at least one more leg
down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Foreign Talk about breakouts and trading ages and breakout
attempts and trading ranges and successful breakouts in trading ranges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clearly a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone knows I always talk about my 80 rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>80% of the time when the market's in a trading range, strong
breakouts fail or all breakouts fail, no matter how strong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So good bold Breakout Reverse Down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Big old breakout Reverse down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20:42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was trying to break out and they're failing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And after a trading range goes on for 20 or more bars, the
probability of a bull breakout becomes the same as for a bear breakout before
the trading.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Make sure in a beer trend and early on, it was more likely
we would get the downside breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But after 20 or more bars, the probability becomes about the
same.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders know that all through here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you decide after 20 or so bars, it's a training
range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders will bet against breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They'll sell bull closes near the top, they'll buy air
closes near the bottom, they'll buy reversals up near the bottom, they'll sell
reversals down near the top and they scout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They take quick profits because they know the odds are
breakouts will not be successful.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So they're scalping bulls and bears are buying low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21:34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bears are buying low to buy back the shorts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both are selling high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bulls are selling high to sell on their ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But both know that because of the market cycle, the market's
either in a trend or a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if it's in a trend, eventually it becomes a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If it's in a trading range, eventually it becomes a trend
trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders keep buying low, selling high and scalping, knowing
that eventually there'll be a successful breakout and they might lose.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But if they take enough trades in here, profitable trades in
here, they're hoping to make enough money so that it more than offsets the
final losing trade.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pulls by the bottom third scale and lower, scalp up and
bears sell on the top third scale and higher, confident that the bull breakouts
will fail and eventually there is a successful breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22:32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But at this point it's 50 bet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Will it be up or down?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a pretty big bear bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can say, well, Al, it's a big bear bar and it's 60 or 70
bars into a trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Isn't that an exhaustion bar instead of a measuring
gap?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, it's not really in a trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The market was sideways for 30, 40, 50 bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this is probably the start of a bear trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bigger the bar is, the more likely the bears will get
follow through selling.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The more it closes on its low instead of having a big tail
on the bottom, the more likely it'll lead to a leg down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the more this close is below the trading range, the more
likely we'll go down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the more bars that this bar closes below, the more
likely we're going to go down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23:25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this has everything going for a big bar closing on a
slope, closing below the trading range, closing far below the trading range,
closing below the lows of the past 50 or 60 bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So probably going to be some kind of a measuring gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bulls were buying low, they're also buying below bars below
this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls Will buy below this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Closer by.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Below this bar, bulls will buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as this bar closes, they place a limit order to buy that
low and they get this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're a bull and you've got long right here, as the
market fell below that low, what do you do at this point?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You know, it's probably a measuring gap that we're going
lower.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you got to sell out of your logs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24:09</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can either do it immediately or you can wait for any
kind of a pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But if you wait for a pullback and you're selling, you know
the bears are going to sell as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are some bears who did not sell this breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a surprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're waiting for a pullback to sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So both bulls and bears are waiting for a pullback to
sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It means that whenever this leg ends and we get a pullback,
probably bulls and bears will sell the pullback and we'll get at least one more
leg down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Okay?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Applause.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bears after their breakout got their minimum.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The absence of a bull bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls have a bull bar here, but chances are this is
enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24:54</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Follow through this bar and that bar so that there are more
sellers above this bull bar than there are buyers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both bulls and bears will use this little reversal attempt
to sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bears will sell into new shorts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bears who did not yet sell and bulls will sell to get
out of their losing longs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It does not matter if you sold here or here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You stop is still up here at the top of the bear leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe you can put it above the top of this cell climax or
above the top of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the startle where the market clearly became
bearish.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But in any case, you got to put a stop fairly far up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What does that tell you?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Risk reward, probability, right?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you stop as far, so your risk is greater.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25:43</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, you're fairly far into the trend, so there's less
reward.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So selling anywhere in here has bad risk reward.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you have bad risk reward, you know you have good
probability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the probability is you're falling more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say you sold anywhere in here and you say, gosh, my
stop is way up there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don't want to risk that much.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And a lot of the computers that did short through here
decide that the risk is too great.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when the risk is great, they have to reduce the
risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The easiest way is to take profits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when the computers or traders take profits on profitable
shorts, they get a little reversal attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is not so much due to aggressive bull spying as it is
to bears looking at their stop being so far away that their risk is now
big.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26:37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It does not matter where you sold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you sold here, if you sold here, if you sold short,
that's your risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So your entry price has nothing to do with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All that matters is where your stock is, wherever you
entered, irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're still short down here, that's your risk, that's
how much money you're risking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And a lot of bears will buy back some of the shorts and it
creates that little pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of times there's a little pullback like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bears will wait a few bars to make sure the bulls do not
get a micro double bottom and a big reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So a lot of times you go sideways for several bars after the
profit taking, but the probability still is that the market will go
lower.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say a bull does not buy back as long here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27:25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe he's thinking, oh, we should get higher up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We should overlap that low, maybe get up to the top of the
cell phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some bulls want a higher pullback to exit with a small
loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So a lot of bulls will wait to sell out of their losing
longs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And sometimes the bears will wait as well, thinking, oh no,
maybe this does not look like particularly good follow through tight trading
range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe we will go up a little bit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm going to wait a few bars before I sell because I'd like
to sell higher and I'll give it a few bars to see if it'll go higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If it does not and instead it starts to go down, I'll sell
the breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The downside breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bears are giving a chance to the bulls.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Okay, bulls, how strong can you be?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28:13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Are you going to be able to turn the market up a little
bit?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if you do, then I get to sell at a higher price.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you have bears wanting to sell and waiting to sell,
waiting to see if they can get the sell higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're going to sell either way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of times after a little bit of profit taken like this,
the bears wait to see if the bulls can lift the market higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then they sell bears.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You see the bulls having a micro double bottom but tight
trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And is this the second leg down?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is it leg one pullback, leg two?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or our traders still betting that this is going to be a
measuring gap and that will fall for a measure down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think the probability still favors the bears.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28:55</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We'll see a micro bottom, hoping that we'll get a higher
bounce.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of the bulls will use any minor Reversal like this to
sell out of their lungs and they'll give up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we might get another breakout bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To the downside, the bear cell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Knowing that the bulls will use any kind of a bounce to
sell, bears know that the bulls probably will wait many more bars before they
buy again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the market starts to go down after this attack attempt at
the bottom, the bears know the bulls will probably wait 3, 4, 5, 6 bars before
they buy again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we can get vacuumed down pretty quickly, creating a very
strong second leg down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because of that, beers will sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29:37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Knowing that there are not enough bulls at this price, the
market has to go lower to find a price where bulls would be willing to
buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So bear sell and you get a breakout bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A bear breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls who want in here are giving up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bears who wanted to sell higher decided that it's not
going higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So they sold it here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This range might be too tight to trade, but if a person were
trading it, they want to buy in the bottom third and sell in the top
third.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bulls and bears.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bulls buy in the bottom third hoping for a scalp up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then they sell in the top third, take profits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bears sell in the top third hoping for a scalp down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When it gets to the bottom, they buy and take profits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30:23</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And both are willing to scale in.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Everyone knows eventually there's going to be a successful
breakout after 20 or 30 bars in a trading range, the probability of a bull
breakout is the same as the probability of a bear breakdown.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And they hope to make enough money scalping, especially with
limit orders and scaling in during the trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So that when the breakout finally comes and they finally
lose, they'll have enough winnings to more than offset that loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, when a range is this tight, I think most traders
should not trade.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the dollar versus the yen bulls binding to the
bottom, confident the bear breakout will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be selling the top, confident the bull breakout will
fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And Both are correct.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>80% of all breakouts fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So traders are willing to buy low, sell high and scalp other
traders.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most traders know the range is this tight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most traders should wait for the breakout and see what it
looks like.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Early in the breakout, bears will sell the bull close at the
top of the range, betting it will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But now we have a bull breakout closing on its high, closing
above the top of the range, closing above the top of the past 50, 60, 70
bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then we have a follow through bull bar tail on the
top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, weakens the case for the bulls.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But close above the middle of the bar and a Second close
above the trading range probability is measuring gap, not exhaustion gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So probably going up for at least measured move based on the
height of this range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31:55</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So somewhere up here and strong enough breakout so that if
we try to reverse down, bulls and bears will buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bulls will buy, hoping to be buying low, expecting a second
leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bears will buy because they see a strong breakout with
follow through, knowing a second leg up is likely.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there they'll buy back their shorts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of beers wait for that follow through bar here or here
and then conclude that this is just too strong on a buy at the market and
chances are we're going to get some kind of call to move up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This looks like buy the close, maybe starting here, every
bull close and just keep buying, betting that going higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some kind of a measurement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every bar that gets added to it increases the profit
target.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32:46</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because one of the profit targets is simply based upon the
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the open of the first part of the breakout to the close
of the final bar of the breakout, usually you get some kind of a measured
info.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now suppose you bought below this bear bar, or above this
bull bar, or even this close of this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let's say you bought here, where's your shot?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For all of the traders, it's the same below the bottom of
the bull leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your stop has nothing to do with where you entered.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It has only to do with the price action.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if you're buying on the bet that it's a swing up, it
does not matter where you bought.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All that matters is where the stock goes below the bottom of
the most recent higher low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>33:26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So down here, at some point traders start to get
uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They say, wow, gosh, my shop is way down there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I don't want to risk that much.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the computers have protective algorithms within
them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So whenever the stock gets too far, they conclude the risk
is too big.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They have to control the risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Easiest way to control risk is take profits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's why you get a pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even though it's a very strong bull trend, you still get a
pullback because at some point too many traders, too many computers decide they
have to take some profits to reduce their position size so that profit taking
creates the pullback, but it's still a gold flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bears who sold for any reason are hoping for a deeper
pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34:10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If they did not give up here, most did give up here, or if
they did not, they're hoping for a deeper pullback that would allow them to
exit with a smaller loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Somebody is selling up here and they Need a deeper pullback
to make a profit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So bears are looking to buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And when you get a pullback like this, a lot of times the
bulls will wait five or ten bars to see how low the bears can drive the
market.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls want to buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They'd like to buy down here, but they'll buy for any
reason.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if the bears are not successful in lowering the price
after about five or 10 bars, the bulls will just buy at the market or they'll
buy a both bars with a stock.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Betting on a second leg up and the bears are not
successful.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>34:52</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the bears are shorted in here and the bears are shorted
down here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And who did not get out here will give up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that will create a second leg up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If this grows to 20 or 30 bars, then we're back in another
trading match.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After about 10 bars or so, bears start to buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Getting nervous that it's not going down and they've got to
take their loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And bulls begin to buy as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Same reason it's not going down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Odds are we're going up to some kind of a measured
move.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And after five or ten bars, but it's not going down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I want to buy, so I'll start buying with stocks or at the
market.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then we got a little bit more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By the close, after 3, 4, 5 bull bars, reversal attempts
probably fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pretty tight little channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>35:45</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not much in terms of big bear bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So more likely these reversal attempts will fail and will
continue higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls know the bears are trapped.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So when it starts to go up, even though the bars are small,
once you start to get three or four bull bars, the bulls know the bears will
give up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the bulls are buying and the bears n do give up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe that bull trend bar there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this video I talked about the importance of a strong
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because if it's strong enough, the odds are the first
pullback will be followed by a second leg.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then next I talk about successful trading range
breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm Al Brooks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thank you for watching the Brooks trading course.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the third of eight videos on breakouts.&nbsp;</p>
