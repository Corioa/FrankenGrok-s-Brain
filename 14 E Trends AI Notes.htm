<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Grok's
Strategy:&nbsp;</span></u><br>
</b><br>
<br>
Here's a summary of a price action trading strategy for a day trader based on
Al Brooks' methodology from the transcription provided:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Al Brooks' Price Action Trading Strategy:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trends and Channels:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tight Channels</b>: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends</b>: When in a tight bull channel, only
      look to buy. This is because such conditions often indicate a breakout on
      a higher time frame chart, suggesting strong bullish momentum.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends</b>: Conversely, in a tight bear channel,
      only look to sell. The strategy emphasizes selling into pullbacks as
      these are often minor within a strong downtrend.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Small Pullback Trends</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Characteristics</b>: These are considered one of the
      strongest types of trends. They are identified by small pullbacks (often
      one or two bars long), numerous doji bars, and body gaps rather than full
      gaps.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: </li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Buying</b>: In bull trends, look to buy on pullbacks,
       especially if they form body gaps or if the pullback does not go below
       the previous breakout point. Use stops just below the breakout point or
       recent higher lows for risk management.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Selling</b>: In bear trends, look to sell on
       pullbacks that stay above the previous breakout point but do not overlap
       with the body of the breakout bar.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broad vs. Tight Channels</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>If it's unclear whether the market is in a tight or broad
      channel, assume it's tight and trade accordingly. In bull trends, this
      means buying; in bear trends, selling.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Gaps and Overlaps</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Gaps</b>: Presence of gaps, even small body gaps,
      signals strength in the current trend direction. In a bull trend, gaps
      mean buying opportunity; in a bear trend, they mean selling.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Overlaps</b>: Overlaps can indicate weakening trends
      but are not always a sign to reverse your strategy. For example, in a
      bull trend, if pullbacks start to overlap with previous bars' bodies but
      not tails, it might still be strong, but caution is advised.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Late Day Dynamics</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Be wary of late-day breakouts or reversals which might be
      climactic or indicate exhaustion. However, if the market has been in a
      small pullback trend for hours, even late-day breakouts might still be
      part of the trend's continuation rather than a reversal.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stops</b>: Place stops based on the market context. In
      strong trends, stops can be placed further away from the entry point to
      account for small pullbacks, acknowledging that while this increases
      risk, it also allows for higher probability trades.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Time Frame Consideration</b>:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Always consider what the trend looks like on a higher
      time frame chart. What might look like a minor pullback on a 5-minute
      chart could be part of a significant breakout on a 15 or 30-minute chart.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This strategy focuses on reading price action in real-time,
understanding the context of pullbacks within trends, and using this
information to trade in the direction of the trend with disciplined risk management.
Remember, Al Brooks emphasizes that small pullback trends often look weaker
than they are, especially when gaps are present, leading traders to sometimes
underestimate the trend's strength.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Exit
Plan:&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>in the context of this video, in as many words as you
think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader EXITS a
position</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Al Brooks offers a nuanced approach to exiting positions in his discussion on
trends, focusing particularly on the dynamics of tight channels, small
pullbacks, and the strategic use of price action for both entry and exit.
Here's a detailed breakdown of how he recommends traders exit positions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. Exit Strategy in Tight Channels:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Confirmation</b>: Brooks advises that in tight
     channels, which he views as strong trends or breakouts on higher time
     frames, traders should exit positions if the market fails to continue in
     the direction of the breakout. For instance, in a bull channel, if a
     breakout attempt fails and price action shows weakness or reversal, it's
     time to exit. </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;And if it's difficult to tell
      whether it's a breakout or a tight channel, assume it's a breakout and
      trade it like a breakout and only look to buy because it is the breakout
      on a higher time frame chart.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Placement</b>: He suggests placing stops just
     beyond points where the market's behavior would contradict the breakout
     premise, like below a recent breakout point in a bull trend or above in a
     bear trend.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Small Pullback Trends:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting on Reversal Signals</b>: In small pullback
     trends, Brooks recommends exiting if there are clear signs of trend
     reversal, such as when a pullback goes beyond what's expected or if
     there's a significant breakout failure. </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight</b>: &quot;Here we got a bull breakout tried
      to fail. Try to reverse here. But these bars held above the breakout
      point. And that is a sign of a very strong bull trend. So you do not want
      to sell.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Taking</b>: He implies taking profits when the
     market shows signs of exhaustion, particularly if these signs appear late
     in the trend:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;One other thought about this is
      the best looking bull bar. Probably we got one comparable here, but
      certainly one of the best one or two bull bars. And it's occurring late
      in a bull trend. So that's an increased risk of exhaustion.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Gaps and Overlaps:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting on Gap Failures</b>: When trading based on gaps
     or body gaps, Brooks suggests exiting if these gaps close or if the price
     action shows the gap was a false signal of strength.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Statement</b>: &quot;The gaps are staying open. That
      is a sign of a strong trend.&quot; Thus, if gaps start closing, it might
      signal a good exit point.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Body Gap Considerations</b>: Even with body gaps, if
     overlap occurs, it might be time to reconsider holding the position,
     especially if other signs of weakness appear.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4. Late-Day Market Dynamics:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Climactic Moves</b>: Brooks warns about late-day
     breakouts or significant moves which could be climactic or indicative of
     trend exhaustion. He advises traders to be ready to exit if these moves
     fail to continue or if the market shows signs of reversal:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;You get a breakout that is 50 to
      100 bigger than the biggest prior breakout... But chances are the beers
      will fail and the reversal attempt will become a bull flag.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5. Using Stops for Strategy:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Wide Stops for Trend Continuation</b>: For those in
     strong trends, Brooks advocates for using wider stops to allow for small
     pullbacks while still capturing the bulk of the trend movement. However,
     if the price hits these stops, it's a clear exit signal.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight</b>: &quot;The wider the stop you use on any
      trade, the higher the probability is that you make money. When you do
      lose, you obviously lose more than with a tight stop.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Adjusting Stops</b>: He also suggests moving stops to
     lock in profits as the trend progresses or as new support/resistance
     levels form. For example, after a strong breakout, you might raise your
     stop to just below the new support level.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>6. Psychological and Strategic Exits:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting When Premise Fails</b>: If the market does not
     behave as expected based on your entry rationale, Brooks advises exiting
     the position. This involves recognizing when your trading premise is no
     longer valid.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Philosophy</b>: &quot;I typically don't call this a
      small pullback bull trend, although it clearly is to me. It's just so
      climatic and so extreme. I think of it more as a buy climax.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Taking Profits in Overbought/Oversold Conditions</b>:
     When the market has been trending above or below average prices for an
     extended period, Brooks hints at taking profits, especially if the market
     starts to revert towards these averages.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In essence, Brooks' exit strategy revolves around reading
price action to understand when a trend might be weakening or reversing, using
stops strategically, and being responsive to market context, especially on
higher time frames. His approach emphasizes exiting when the market no longer
supports your initial trading thesis or when signs of trend exhaustion or
reversal are evident.</p>

words”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk185424610"><b><br>
Executive Summary:</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Al Brooks' video on trends focuses on trading strategies for
tight channels and small pullback trends in price action. Tight channels,
whether bullish or bearish, represent strong trends where traders should align
their trades with the channel direction – buying in bull channels and selling
in bear channels. These channels are often indicative of breakouts on higher
time frame charts, suggesting traders should not fight the trend but trade in
its direction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Small pullback trends are highlighted as one of the
strongest trend types due to their brief, shallow pullbacks, often lasting only
one or two bars. Despite appearances of weakness with many doji bars and small
trend bars, these trends are robust, especially when accompanied by gaps or
body gaps (where the bodies of bars do not overlap). Here, Brooks advises
buying in bull trends when pullbacks hold above breakout points or selling in
bear trends under similar conditions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The video emphasizes recognizing the difference between
broad and tight channels, advising to err on the side of tight when unsure,
which implies a directional bias. It also discusses late-day market movements,
where breakouts can be climactic but still part of the ongoing trend, not
necessarily reversals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks stresses the importance of context, particularly
viewing trends across different time frames, and advocates for a strategy where
traders use wider stops to accommodate small pullbacks in strong trends,
thereby increasing the probability of successful trades. The overall message is
to understand the market's current state, align trades with the trend, and
manage risk appropriately by considering the market's strength on higher time
frames.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Look through the transcript at the references to the
specific examples Brooks makes, and talk about what he talks about, how it
relates to the context of the whole video, using specific quotations from
Brooks to make your points, both specific to his point or in a broader
context.&quot;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here's an analysis of Al Brooks' specific examples from the transcript, using
direct quotations to illustrate how these examples tie into the broader context
of his discussion on trends:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. Bull Trend Example:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Point</b>: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks discusses a scenario where it's unclear if a market
     move is part of a breakout or just within a channel, emphasizing buying in
     bull trends:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Sometimes you see a trend like this, we got a spike
      up and then a channel and it's difficult to know if this is still part of
      the breakout phase or if it's part of a channel on a higher time frame
      chart. It is part of the breakout.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context</b>:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>This example supports Brooks' strategy of assuming
     breakouts when unsure about the nature of the trend, advocating for
     trading in the direction of the trend:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;And if it's difficult to tell whether it's a
      breakout or a tight channel, assume it's a breakout and trade it like a
      breakout and only look to buy because it is the breakout on a higher time
      frame chart.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Bear Trend Example:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Point</b>: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>He describes how to sell in a bear trend, focusing on the
     strength of the trend even when it appears weak:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Here we got a bull breakout tried to fail. Try to
      reverse here. But these bars held above the breakout point. And that is a
      sign of a very strong bull trend. So you do not want to sell.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context</b>: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks uses this to explain that in bear trends, the
     market might attempt reversals, but the trend's strength often prevails,
     advising traders to continue selling:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;So you only look to sell. And these gaps that we're
      getting are a sign that it's a very strong trend and you should not be
      buying.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Gaps and Doji Bars:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Point</b>: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks points out that small pullback trends might look
     weak with doji bars but are actually strong, especially with gaps:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;A lot of weak looking bull bars do not sell because
      on a higher time frame, it's a full breakout.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Small pullback bull trends, they do have a lot of
      small dojis. And the market is in one of the strongest types of trends
      you don't want to be selling.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context</b>:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>These examples are used to teach traders not to be misled
     by superficial price action weakness, emphasizing the importance of
     looking for signs of underlying strength like gaps:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;But once you start to see gaps, even if the gaps
      are not particularly impressive, you have to assume that it's a small
      pullback trend and not a leg within our trading range.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4. Late Day Breakouts:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Point</b>: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Discussing late-day market behavior where traders might
     see breakouts or reversals:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Usually around 11:00, 10:00, sometimes 12:00, but
      usually around 11:00, 11:30, you get a breakout that is 50 to 100 bigger
      than the biggest prior breakout.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context</b>: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>This example is used to caution traders about climactic
     moves late in the day, which might be misinterpreted as trend reversals
     but often indicate continuation or exhaustion:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;But chances are the beers will fail and the
      reversal attempt will become a bull flag.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5. Time Frame Analysis:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Point</b>: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks stresses the importance of viewing trends across
     different time frames to understand true market direction:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Here's a five minute chart, small pullback, bear
      trim. And this is what it looks like on a 30 minute chart. Higher time
      frame chart, Almost all bear bars, mostly a bear micro channel. So it's a
      bear breakout.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context</b>: </p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>This illustrates the need for context in trading, where
     what looks like a minor move on one chart could be part of a significant
     trend on another:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;These trends are breakouts on higher time frame
      charts. So here's a five minute chart, small pullback, bear trim. And
      this is what it looks like on a 30 minute chart.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through these examples, Brooks conveys a methodology
centered on understanding market structure, recognizing trend strength, and
aligning trading strategies with market momentum, always emphasizing the
importance of context, patience, and strategic entry points based on price
action signals.</p>

actions, akin to statements like &quot;when the market comes to the middle 1/3
of the channel, bulls buy again&quot;?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here are some quotations from Al Brooks' transcript that illustrate trading
calculations and behaviors of traders, focusing on specific market conditions
or actions:<br>
<br>
</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Buying in Bull Trends:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;So every time the market tries to reverse and pause
      look to buy with the stock as the market reverses up.&quot; </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>This quotation suggests that traders should look for
      buying opportunities when the market shows signs of a reversal in a bull
      trend, implying a calculation where the probability of continuation is
      high.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Selling in Bear Trends:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;When the channel is this tight. It's a breakout on
      a higher time frame chart. So you only look to sell.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Here, Brooks advises traders to sell in tight bear
      channels, recognizing the market's structure on a higher time frame as a
      cue for trading behavior.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Behavior in Trading Ranges:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;So whenever the market falls somewhere in the
      middle third, they look goodbye. Anytime it goes to a new high, they look
      to sell and they take quick profits because they believe the market's not
      going to go very far.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>This directly relates to your example, describing how
      traders might act within a trading range, buying in the middle third of
      the channel, expecting the market to not move significantly.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reaction to Gaps:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;In small pullback trends, you typically see mostly
      body gaps, but you usually see at least one actual gap.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks explains how traders interpret gaps as a sign of
      trend strength, which influences their decision to enter trades in the
      direction of the gap.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Managing Risk with Stops:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;The wider the stop you use on any trade, the higher
      the probability is that you make money. When you do lose, you obviously
      lose more than with a tight stop.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>This quotation provides insight into how traders
      calculate risk vs. reward, suggesting a broader approach to setting stops
      to increase the probability of successful trades.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Late Day Market Psychology:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Usually if you have a small pullback bull trend,
      you do not get a reversal. This is really more of a spike and channel
      bull trend or parabolic wedge bull trend and less of a small pullback
      bull trend.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks hints at how traders might adjust their strategies
      based on late-day market behavior, understanding that what might look
      like a reversal could be part of an ongoing trend, influencing trading
      calculations.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Interpreting Market Signs:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;But once you start to see gaps, even if the gaps
      are not particularly impressive, you have to assume that it's a small
      pullback trend and not a leg within our trading range.&quot;</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>This reflects a calculation where traders must interpret
      market signs like gaps as indicators of trend continuation rather than
      just volatility within a range.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>These quotations provide a window into how Al Brooks
describes the thought processes and actions traders should take based on
specific market conditions, aligning with strategic trading in line with price
action signals.</p>

V. Strategy by Brooks in the Context of Video</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I enjoyed what you wrote with what brook says about
trading, in the context of this video. Do you think you could use Brooks'
examples, statements, and quips, to elucidate a contrast of his philosophy
(contrast, list, whatever) between tactics and strategy in regards to the
content of this video?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here's a structured comparison between tactics and strategy as discussed by Al
Brooks in the context of the specific transcript provided, focusing on the
fifth video in his series on trends:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tight Channels:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Buying in tight bull channels and selling
     in tight bear channels based on the assumption of breakouts on higher time
     frames.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example:</b> &quot;And if it's difficult to tell
     whether it's a breakout or a tight channel, assume it's a breakout and
     trade it like a breakout and only look to buy because it is the breakout
     on a higher time frame chart.&quot; This tactic involves trading directionally
     based on channel tightness.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Small Pullback Trends:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Entering trades on small pullbacks in
     strong trends, looking for buying opportunities in bull trends and selling
     in bear trends.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Statement:</b> &quot;So every time the market tries to
     reverse and pause look to buy with the stock as the market reverses
     up.&quot; Here, the tactic is to use these small pullbacks as entry
     points.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Gaps and Body Gaps:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Using gaps, especially body gaps, as
     signals to enter trades, acknowledging the strength of the trend even when
     the price action appears weak.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight:</b> &quot;One of the hallmarks of a small
     pullback trend is gap formation.&quot; This reflects a tactic where
     traders capitalize on gaps for directional trades.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Late-Day Breakouts:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Being cautious with late-day breakouts,
     expecting them to fail and become flags rather than true reversals.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Example:</b> &quot;But chances are the beers
     will fail and the reversal attempt will become a bull flag.&quot; This
     tactic involves preparing for trend continuation rather than reversal.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trading in the Middle Third:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Buying or selling when the price reaches
     the middle third of a channel, expecting the market to not move
     significantly from there.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation:</b> &quot;So whenever the market falls
     somewhere in the middle third, they look goodbye.&quot; This is a tactical
     approach to trading within channels.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Higher Time Frame Analysis:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Always considering the market's behavior
     on higher time frames to understand true trend direction and strength.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation:</b> &quot;These trends are breakouts on
     higher time frame charts.&quot; This strategy guides traders to see beyond
     the immediate chart to grasp the larger market context.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Strength Recognition:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Understanding that trends can be
     deceptive; what looks weak might actually be strong, especially in small
     pullback trends.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Philosophy:</b> &quot;Small pullback bull trends, they
     do have a lot of small dojis. And the market is in one of the strongest
     types of trends you don't want to be selling.&quot; This strategy
     emphasizes trading with the trend despite deceptive price action.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management via Stops:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Using stops not just for protection but
     also to enhance trade probability by allowing for market noise while still
     managing risk.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight:</b> &quot;The wider the stop you use on any
     trade, the higher the probability is that you make money.&quot; This
     strategy involves aligning stop placement with market context.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Market Psychology and Behavior:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Anticipating how traders will react
     during different parts of the trading day, particularly late in the
     session, to adjust trading strategies.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example:</b> &quot;Usually if you have a small pullback
     bull trend, you do not get a reversal.&quot; This reflects strategic
     thinking about market behavior over time.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Probability-Focused Trading:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Trading based on the likelihood of
     outcomes rather than trying to predict exact price movements.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Rule:</b> &quot;But once you start to see gaps,
     even if the gaps are not particularly impressive, you have to assume that
     it's a small pullback trend and not a leg within our trading range.&quot;
     This strategy promotes trading based on statistical probability.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Contrast:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics</b> in this video are about the immediate
     execution of trades based on specific market conditions like channel
     behavior, pullback size, and the presence of gaps. These are actionable
     steps taken in response to real-time price action.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b> involves the overarching approach to
     trading, where Brooks emphasizes understanding the market's true nature
     through time frame analysis, recognizing trend strength, managing risk
     based on market context, and using market psychology to anticipate movements.
     It's about why you choose certain tactics, focusing on the bigger picture
     of market dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, while tactics are about the how of trading
(specific actions taken), Brooks' strategy in this video is about the why (the
reasoning behind those actions), ensuring that traders align their short-term
moves with the long-term market narrative.</p>

Notes on Video</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Overview</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The &quot;14 E Trends&quot; Educational/Training Session
focused on advanced trading strategies, emphasizing the significance of tight
channels and small pullbacks in identifying strong market trends. Key
discussions highlighted that tight channels often lead to breakouts on higher
time frames and that traders should only enter trades in the direction of these
breakouts. The session outlined the characteristics of small pullback bear
trends, noting that gaps can indicate trend strength and cautioning against
buying in a bear trend until bullish activity emerges. Strategies such as
utilizing wide stops for higher probability trades and recognizing specific
setups like the 20 Gap Bar Buy were also covered, alongside the importance of
measuring pullbacks to assess overall trend strength.</p>

</i><br>
Here is how my summary compares to the one generated by Fireflies.ai, focusing
on overlaps and differences, with emphasis on what Al Brooks specifically
emphasizes in the video:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Overlaps:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tight Channels and Small Pullbacks</b>: Both summaries
     acknowledge that tight channels signify strong trends, particularly when
     they are breakouts on higher time frames. Brooks emphasizes, &quot;Tight
     channels which are strong trends. And I'll also talk about small pullback
     trends which are the strongest types of trends.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Directional Trading in Channels</b>: We both highlight
     Brooks' advice to trade in the direction of the breakout in tight
     channels. He states, &quot;And if it's difficult to tell whether it's a
     breakout or a tight channel, assume it's a breakout and trade it like a
     breakout and only look to buy because it is the breakout on a higher time
     frame chart.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Gaps as Indicators</b>: Both summaries note the
     importance of gaps in indicating trend strength. Brooks mentions,
     &quot;One of the hallmarks of a small pullback trend is gap
     formation.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Late-Day Breakouts</b>: We both touch on Brooks'
     discussion of late-day market behavior, where breakouts might fail and
     turn into flags, as Brooks says, &quot;Usually if you have a small
     pullback bull trend, you do not get a reversal... chances are the beers
     will fail and the reversal attempt will become a bull flag.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Differences:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Depth of Strategy Discussion</b>: My summary delves
     deeper into specific trading strategies like the use of wide stops for
     higher probability trades, which Brooks elaborates on by saying, &quot;The
     wider the stop you use on any trade, the higher the probability is that
     you make money.&quot; Fireflies.ai mentions this but does not explore the
     strategic implications to the same extent.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Detailed Examples</b>: My summary provides more direct
     quotations and detailed examples from Brooks, like the 20 Gap Bar Buy
     Setup, &quot;I think of it as a 20 Gap bar buy setup. And a lot of bulls
     will place limit orders to buy the moving average, at least for a scalp.&quot;
     This gives readers a clearer understanding of specific tactics Brooks
     advocates for.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pullback Analysis</b>: While both summaries mention
     pullbacks, mine emphasizes Brooks' point about measuring pullbacks to
     assess trend strength, &quot;Measure pullbacks to gauge trend
     strength,&quot; offering a practical approach to trend analysis not as
     explicitly covered in the Fireflies summary.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends</b>: My summary might place more emphasis
     on the nuanced discussion of bear trends, particularly the caution against
     buying in a bear trend until there's evidence of bullish activity. Brooks
     notes, &quot;In general, a trader should not be buying in a bear trend
     until he sees limit order bulls making money.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Salient Points to Focus On:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding Market Context</b>: Brooks' frequent
     references to higher time frame charts for context are crucial. This
     understanding helps traders avoid misinterpretations of market movements.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Gaps and Trend Strength</b>: The discussion on gaps,
     especially body gaps, is pivotal. Brooks' insights like, &quot;Body gaps
     still indicate bear strength even with some overlap,&quot; highlight how
     traders can refine their trend analysis.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management</b>: The strategic use of stops and
     understanding risk versus reward, as Brooks explains, is fundamental to
     trading success.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Psychology</b>: Late-day dynamics and how
     traders react to these, as Brooks describes, give insight into market
     psychology and potential trading opportunities or traps.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In essence, both summaries aim to capture the strategic
essence of Brooks' teachings, but mine provides a more in-depth exploration of
specific tactics and risk management strategies through direct quotations,
aligning closely with Brooks' detailed explanations in the video.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<u>Chosen Indicator</u>: Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Important/Featured Topic(s)</u>: Tight Channels and Small
Pullback Trends</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>How VWAP Works</u>:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VWAP calculates the average price of a security weighted by
trading volume over a specific time period, typically the trading day. It's
computed by:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>VWAP=&#8721;(Pi×Vi)&#8721;Vi</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where Pi is the price of each trade, and Vi is the volume of
that trade. VWAP provides a benchmark of where the market has been trading on
average, considering both price and volume, which gives a more comprehensive
view than just the simple moving average.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Interpretation and Use in Context:</u></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Tight Channels: In a tight channel scenario, VWAP acts as
     a dynamic level of support or resistance. If the price is consistently
     above VWAP in a bull trend, it indicates strong buying pressure,
     suggesting traders should look to buy on pullbacks towards VWAP, expecting
     the breakout to continue. Conversely, in a bear trend, if the price is
     below VWAP, it suggests selling pressure, where traders might look to sell
     into any rallies back to VWAP.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Small Pullback Trends: For small pullbacks, VWAP can help
     identify whether these pullbacks are merely corrections within a strong
     trend or signs of reversal. If the price pulls back to VWAP but doesn't
     significantly breach it, this could be seen as a buying opportunity in a
     bull trend, signaling that the pullback is likely just a minor correction.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

 <li class=MsoNormal>Entry Points: VWAP offers clear entry points for trades.
     In bullish scenarios, buying near VWAP on pullbacks can be strategic,
     especially if other price action supports this (like small body gaps or
     doji bars).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Exit Points: Conversely, in bearish trends, selling when
     the price approaches or briefly exceeds VWAP can be effective,
     particularly if the move lacks volume or follow-through.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Risk Management: VWAP can inform stop placement; setting
     stops just beyond VWAP can help manage risk while still giving room for
     the natural ebb and flow of price in strong trends.</li>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Speculation on Al Brooks' Commentary by Grok</u>:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>On VWAP in Tight Channels: &quot;When you're dealing with
     tight channels, VWAP isn't just another line; it's your guidepost. If the
     price is above VWAP, you're in a breakout phase, and you should be looking
     to buy, not sell. It tells you the market's momentum is strong enough to
     push through, so align your trades with that.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>On VWAP and Small Pullback Trends: &quot;Small pullback
     trends might look weak, but they're often the strongest you'll see. VWAP
     gives you the context. When the price pulls back to VWAP but holds, that's
     your signal to jump in. Those gaps or even body gaps around VWAP? They're
     telling you the trend's still got legs, so use VWAP to buy into that
     strength.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Using VWAP for Day Trading: &quot;Day trading without
     considering VWAP is like driving without a map. It shows you where the
     volume has been, giving you a true sense of the market's direction. If
     you're seeing the price respect VWAP, you've got your strategy. But if it
     breaks VWAP with conviction, that's your warning to either get out or look
     for a trade in the new direction.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>This approach not only aligns with Brooks' focus on price
action and trend analysis but also incorporates the volume dimension that VWAP
brings to the table, enhancing decision-making in day trading scenarios.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Training course this is the.&nbsp;This is Al
Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you for watching the Brooks training course.&nbsp;This is
the fifth of five videos on trends.&nbsp;In this video I'm going to be talking
about tight channels which are strong trends.&nbsp;And I'll also talk about
small pullback trends which are the strongest types of trends.&nbsp;Sometimes
you see a trend like this, we got a spike up and then a channel and it's
difficult to know if this is still part of the breakout phase or if it's part
of a channel on a higher time frame chart.&nbsp;It is part of the
breakout.&nbsp;And if it's difficult to tell whether it's a breakout or a tight
channel, assume it's a breakout and trade it like a breakout and only look to
buy because it is the breakout on a higher time frame chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>00:58</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's clearly a bull trend.&nbsp;So you should only
buy.&nbsp;Can you sell?&nbsp;I would only buy whenever the market is in a
fairly typical channel.&nbsp;It's a breakout on a higher time frame
chart.&nbsp;It's much easier to make money looking to buy.&nbsp;The odds of
making money as a bear are small, so better only if you look to buy.&nbsp;So
let's say this is a five minute surprises me.&nbsp;A tight channel is weak
compared to a breakout, but it's still a pretty strong bull trend.&nbsp;The
pullback only lasted one bar.&nbsp;Pullback only lasted one bar here, no
pullback at all.&nbsp;Even if you do get a reversal, it's probably minor and
you're probably going to get at least a little bit more up.&nbsp;So I think of
a tight channel as a strong trend and I trade it like a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>01:54</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I said on a higher time frame chart, it is a
breakup.&nbsp;So for example, five minute chart.&nbsp;This green box here, this
green box is the same bars but this is a 15 minute chart and it's clearly
simply a strong breakout.&nbsp;And you don't want to be selling so you only
want to be trading in the direction of the breakout type bear channel.&nbsp;The
pullbacks are small, they're not going very far up and the channel down is very
tight.&nbsp;It's a breakout on some higher time frame chart.&nbsp;There are
always different ways to draw the channel.&nbsp;This is one way.&nbsp;You can
also draw it that way as well.&nbsp;And it does not matter when the pullbacks
are small.&nbsp;You only want to be looking to sell.&nbsp;And here we got a gap
this low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>02:41</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These highs, the market's forming gaps or you only want to
be selling.&nbsp;And if you want, you can sell with stops on reversals
down.&nbsp;So you wait For a reversal up to fail.&nbsp;And then you keep
looking to sell below the low of the prior bar, betting that the bull reversal
will fail and that the bull reversal in fact will simply be a bear
flag.&nbsp;Here you sell.&nbsp;Does not matter if this goes above that, we're
still forming lower highs, major lower highs.&nbsp;This is a minor lower high.&nbsp;So
it does not matter that we go above it.&nbsp;Traders should only be looking to
sell.&nbsp;When the channel is this tight.&nbsp;It's a breakout on a higher
time frame chart.&nbsp;So you only look to sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>03:22</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And these gaps that we're getting are a sign that it's a
very strong trend and you should not be buying.&nbsp;We'll break out a
channel.&nbsp;We have pullbacks, we have some beer bars, but the pullbacks only
last a bar or so and they do not fall very far.&nbsp;And our higher time frame
chart is a breakout.&nbsp;Many ways to draw the channel, this is one
way.&nbsp;And you can also draw it like that.&nbsp;And the channels, they're
never perfect.&nbsp;They're rarely perfect.&nbsp;Doesn't matter when the channel
is very tight like this.&nbsp;Only look to buy.&nbsp;Every time you see a
reversal attempt expected to fail become a bull flag and then buy for the
stop.&nbsp;Above the high of the prior bar gaps, we have a reversal
attempt.&nbsp;But the low of the reversal did not fall above the high of the
breakout point.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>04:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again here, bull breakout tried to fail.&nbsp;Try to reverse
here.&nbsp;But these bars held above the breakout point.&nbsp;And that is a
sign of a very strong bull trend.&nbsp;So you do not want to sell.&nbsp;This is
unlike a broad channel where the pullbacks last five, ten bars or
more.&nbsp;And sometimes the breakout is strong enough to make the
market.&nbsp;Always in short.&nbsp;So we got a big breakout bar and a follow
through bar.&nbsp;Probably always in short, but we're still getting higher
lows.&nbsp;And this still could be a broad bull channel.&nbsp;A broad channel
like this to me is basically a trading range that sloped upward.&nbsp;And you
can trade both as a bull and as a bear.&nbsp;But because it's a bull trend in
general, it's easier to make money buying.&nbsp;It's also a pair of trading
agents.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>05:09</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We had a trading range and then a breakout and another
trading range.&nbsp;And that's often the case.&nbsp;That's usually the
case.&nbsp;Whenever the market's in a broad channel, it's usually also spending
a lot of time in trading ranges.&nbsp;Trading range, two sided
trading.&nbsp;Traders tend to buy low, sell high and scalp.&nbsp;So whenever
the market is either a trading range or a broad channel, traders will often
trade in both Directions and they'll take quick profits because they believe
the market's not going to go very far.&nbsp;So they buy low, sell high and
scalp.&nbsp;So whenever the market falls somewhere in the middle third, they
look goodbye.&nbsp;Anytime it goes to a new high, they look to sell and they
take quick profits because they believe the market's not going to go very
far.&nbsp;So you got a bull channel, is it tight or broad?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>06:03</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, sometimes you're in that gray zone where you don't
really know.&nbsp;Here we got a two bar pullback, little one bar pull back
here, two bar pullback here.&nbsp;You know a little trading range here.&nbsp;Is
it a tight channel or is it a breakout on a higher time frame?&nbsp;Chart is
probably a breakout.&nbsp;But whenever I'm looking at any chart and I'm
deciding broad or tight channel, I always assume tight and therefore I only
want to look to buy until there's more evidence that the market is two sided.&nbsp;If
you cannot tell broad or tight, only look goodbye like in this example.&nbsp;So
every time the market tries to reverse and pause look to buy with the stock as
the market reverses up.&nbsp;Small pullback trend, the strongest type of
trend.&nbsp;And it usually is also some other type of trend as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>06:59</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like a trend from the open, the spike in channel
trend.&nbsp;A lot of times there are small trading ranges so it's a trending
trading range day.&nbsp;And the pullbacks, I said it's a small pullback
trend.&nbsp;So the pullbacks are small, they typically do not fall very far and
they typically do not last many bars.&nbsp;So one bar here, one or two bars
here.&nbsp;We're getting reversal attempts and a lot of the rally and a small
pull like bull trend looks like a bull leg in a trading range.&nbsp;You're not
getting consecutive big trend bars.&nbsp;You're getting bars with a lot of
hesitation tails on top air bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>07:34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that is a warning that either a bull leg in a trading
range or if you're starting to get gaps or negative gaps, pullbacks just
dipping a little bit below breakout points or not dipping below at
all.&nbsp;Even though it looks like a bull leg in a trading range, it's
probably a small pullback bull trend, it is probably going a lot
higher.&nbsp;So pullbacks just lasting a few bars, no consecutive big bear
bars.&nbsp;The pullbacks are all less than half the size of an average
bar.&nbsp;A small pullback bull trend is a trend where the pullbacks are small
and they're usually brief.&nbsp;They can last one bar, sometimes they can last
two or three bars.&nbsp;When they do, they're still not Very deep pullbacks are
small.&nbsp;It often begins in the first hour, but it can begin at any point
during the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>08:31</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pullbacks are usually less than half the size of an
average bar.&nbsp;The biggest pullback lasts only a couple bars.&nbsp;Here we
have a pullback lasting a couple of bars.&nbsp;It didn't even fall below the
low of the prior bar.&nbsp;Here we have a pullback that went one bar
down.&nbsp;Another one went one bar down and not very deep.&nbsp;The pullbacks
are less than half the size of an average bar.&nbsp;Typically.&nbsp;This is an
important feature when you have a small pullback bull trend.&nbsp;One of the
ways to be sure that it's unfolding is the presence of gaps.&nbsp;For example,
we have a breakout and this pullback stayed above the high of this
bar.&nbsp;And it also stayed above the high of this bar.&nbsp;So there is a gap
there.&nbsp;And the bull trend resumed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>09:27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The low of this bar, we pull back sideways for a couple of
bars.&nbsp;The low of both of these bars stayed above the high of this
bar.&nbsp;A gap.&nbsp;This tail overlapped the high of this bar, but the bodies
did not overlap.&nbsp;Therefore it's a body gap.&nbsp;I used to call those
negative gaps.&nbsp;And it's still a sign of strength.&nbsp;In small pullback
trends, you typically see mostly body gaps, but you usually see at least one
actual gap.&nbsp;Body gap means that there's a gap between the lows of the
bodies of the pullback bar and the highs of the bodies of the breakout point
bars.&nbsp;So the highs of these bars, the lows of these bars, and that is a
sign of strength here.&nbsp;This bar pulled back below the bar, overlapped the
breakout point slightly, but the bodies did not overlap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10:24</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this body in fact did not even overlap the tail of that
bar.&nbsp;That's a sign of a strong bull trend.&nbsp;And these trends are
breakouts on higher time frame charts.&nbsp;So here's a five minute chart,
small pullback, bear trim.&nbsp;And this is what it looks like on a 30 minute
chart.&nbsp;Higher time frame chart, Almost all bear bars, mostly a bear micro
channel.&nbsp;So it's a bear breakout.&nbsp;Each of these pullbacks means that
it's a channel on the five minute chart.&nbsp;But the absence of pullbacks on
the 30 minute chart means that it's a breakout foreign because this channel is
a breakout on a higher time frame chart.&nbsp;The five minute chart is much
stronger than it appears.&nbsp;A breakout is the strongest type of trend and it
usually leads to some kind of a measured move.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11:25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have a small pullback bear trend, you know it's a
breakout on the higher Time frame charts.&nbsp;And you know, it's therefore one
of the strongest types of trends, even though most of the time it keeps looking
like it's a bare leg in a trading range.&nbsp;These gaps that I talked about
are really important.&nbsp;This is a very strong bear trend and I want to make
some points about gaps.&nbsp;The gaps are staying open.&nbsp;That is a sign of
a strong trend.&nbsp;Here you see no overlap between the pullback and the
breakout point.&nbsp;No overlap, pullback and the breakout point.&nbsp;That's a
sign of a very strong bear trend.&nbsp;Traders who are buying at the low here,
betting that they'll be able to make money buying at the low and scaling and
lower, are getting trapped.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12:20</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They needed this pullback to get above that breakout point
and it did not.&nbsp;And those bulls bought had to sell here for loss.&nbsp;And
that's one of the problems with gaps.&nbsp;The limit order bulls betting that
this is a bare leg in a trading range are losing money and they have to give
up.&nbsp;And it helps drive the trend down lower.&nbsp;In general, a trader
should not be buying in a bear trend until he sees limit order bulls making
money.&nbsp;In other words, he wants to see pullbacks going above breakout
points.&nbsp;For example, here, this pullback went above this breakout
point.&nbsp;Therefore, traders who bought at this low and bought more lower
could make money.&nbsp;Or traders who did not buy at the low and they simply
bought more lower could make money.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13:11</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's usually the first sign that the channel is weakening
and the market might soon enter a trading age.&nbsp;Traders should not be
buying until they're seeing some overlap.&nbsp;And even then it's still better
to only sell.&nbsp;I wanted to make a point here.&nbsp;You can see we have
overlap.&nbsp;The pullback is going above the breakout point.&nbsp;But there's
something very important to notice about this pullback as well, and that's
this.&nbsp;Look at the bodies here, the low of the bodies here, and look at the
highs of the bodies here.&nbsp;The tails are overlapping, but the bodies are
not.&nbsp;And I call that a body gap.&nbsp;And it's still a sign that the bears
are pretty strong.&nbsp;Most traders should not be looking to buy when there
are still body gaps in these very tight bull channels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14:07</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Small pullback trends the market's always trying to reverse,
but the breakouts will fail, become both likes and usually later in the day,
after three, four, five hours of trading.&nbsp;If you're trading stock index
futures a lot of times around 11:00, 10:00, sometimes 12:00, but usually around
11:00, 11:30, you get a breakout that is 50 to 100 bigger than the biggest
prior breakout.&nbsp;So here's the biggest prior breakout.&nbsp;And then here
we got one that's about 50 bigger.&nbsp;And it's an attempt by the bears to
take control and reverse the market late in the day.&nbsp;But chances are the
beers will fail and the reversal attempt will become a bull flag.&nbsp;And a
lot of times it goes up to a new high.&nbsp;At the end of the day, we have a
very strong breakout, another breakout, and then a very small pullback bull
trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15:05</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You hold a tight channel, sometimes you get a bigger
reversal late in the day.&nbsp;This is extremely climactic.&nbsp;It's not a
surprise.&nbsp;And sometimes you get a sell off into the end of the session or
to the close of the day.&nbsp;You know, here we're sideways for 20 to 30
bars.&nbsp;Now we got a double top major trend reversal.&nbsp;We just sold off
slightly to into the close.&nbsp;Sometimes you'll get these small pullback
trends and they actually will reverse.&nbsp;Here we got a spike in channel,
maybe a parabolic wedge.&nbsp;1, 2, 3, nested 1, 2, 3.&nbsp;And then you start
to get an endless pullback in that tight channel like that.&nbsp;You got to be
thinking that the market might be seeing this as a parabolic wedge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15:53</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if it does, a lot of times you'll get a breakout after
20 or 30 bars and then you convert into a bear trend.&nbsp;We got a bear
breakout bear follow through.&nbsp;You can say, well, Al, these are gap
bars.&nbsp;There's a gap between the high of the bar and the moving
average.&nbsp;Won't that lead to a test of the bull trend high and then a major
trend reversal attempt?&nbsp;Well, it typically does, except that this endless
pullback and our tight bear channel has gone on for 20 or more bars and it's making
the market pretty neutral.&nbsp;So this bull reversal may not get very
far.&nbsp;You can see the bad follow through in the market failing to break
strongly above the moving average.&nbsp;Is it now a small pullback bear
trend?&nbsp;Usually I don't think of it that way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16:46</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I think of a small pullback bull trend and then an
endless bear pullback.&nbsp;But to me, this is a real problem for the
bulls.&nbsp;This is so climactic, unsustainable.&nbsp;And now we have an
endless pullback and a beer breakout and a reversal up could not get above the
top of the bear breakout.&nbsp;This might be the start of a bear trend, this
beer breakout bar.&nbsp;So you got to be ready if the market starts to sell
off.&nbsp;Especially once you get another bear bar and a beer follow through bar
traders start to sell Closes and they sell above bull bars.&nbsp;Betting the
reversal up will fail.&nbsp;Usually if you have a small pullback bull trend,
you do not get a reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17:29</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is really more of a spike and channel bull trend or
parabolic wedge bull trend and less of a small pullback bull trend.&nbsp;I
typically don't call this a small pullback bull trend, although it clearly is
to me.&nbsp;It's just so climatic and so extreme.&nbsp;I think of it more as a
buy climax.&nbsp;Remember I said that small pullback bull trends, typically
they have weak bars, a lot of doji bars, primitive tails, bear bars.&nbsp;Looks
like a bow leg in a trading range.&nbsp;That's not the case here.&nbsp;This is
much more of a parabolic bicycle max parabolic wedge, biclimax.&nbsp;This is
more of a small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;Got a lot of bars with
tails.&nbsp;We've got some gaps.&nbsp;Does not look especially strong.&nbsp;No
big bear bars.&nbsp;We're getting bad follow through bull bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18:19</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But here we got a bull breakout and a higher low.&nbsp;So
it's possible that this is a higher low major trend reversal.&nbsp;And this is
maybe a final bear flag.&nbsp;Look.&nbsp;Short two legs up, one pull back, two
short and wedge bottom and then a higher low major trend reversal.&nbsp;So
possible start of a reversal up which we got less common after a small pullback
bear trend.&nbsp;But you still can get it.&nbsp;Higher low, major trend
reversal.&nbsp;Some will say this is the higher low major trend reversal.&nbsp;This
is a double bottom with this bear bar.&nbsp;Other computers will say the double
bottom is here.&nbsp;So it's a double bottom.&nbsp;Higher low, major trend
reversal.&nbsp;Small pullback trends are also tight channels.&nbsp;That only
makes sense, right?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19:16</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the pullbacks are really small and the market's trending
higher, it's going to be in a tight channel.&nbsp;Pullbacks are usually less
than two to three times the size of the smallest scalp.&nbsp;Here we have a
bigger pullback late in the day.&nbsp;Usually it fails to get trend resumption
up and you redraw the channel.&nbsp;So we have a tight channel here.&nbsp;We
broke below it and now the market's resuming up.&nbsp;You redraw the channel
and the distance between the lines is now greater.&nbsp;Channels, as they
mature, transist they mature, typically become weaker and the channels tend to
become broader and flatter.&nbsp;Go flatter.&nbsp;The slope of this new channel
is less than the slope of this original channel.&nbsp;Whatever you think, the
market might be in a fairly strong gold trend.&nbsp;Do not sell.&nbsp;Maybe we
got a bull breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20:14</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do you want to sell or fail breakout?&nbsp;I would
not.&nbsp;Not yet.&nbsp;A lot of beginners like to sell in bull trends because
the stop is close, but they ignore probability.&nbsp;And whenever you're taking
a trade with a low risk, small risk, chances are you're going to lose, the
probability is going to be low.&nbsp;And if you get enough of Those small
losses, 3, 4, 5 small losses, it can add up to a pretty big loss.&nbsp;So
whenever you're in a market where the pullbacks are very small, even if you see
a lot of weak looking bull bars do not sell because on a higher time frame,
it's a full breakout.&nbsp;So the trader sells here, you get stopped
out.&nbsp;Trader sells here, gets stocked up, trader sells here, probably will
get stocked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21:12</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of bulls are afraid to buy because the rally looks
weak.&nbsp;Tight training range with dojis, bull bar, bad follow through bull
bars with doji's bull breakout not all that big.&nbsp;So bulls end up getting
trapped out.&nbsp;At least weak bulls do, because they know where their shop
is.&nbsp;The shop is way down here, so they don't want to be buying too far up
in a rally that looks weak.&nbsp;But if the market is forming gaps and not much
in terms of bear bars, it's perfectly good to buy for any reason and just use
the appropriate stop.&nbsp;Beginners, they just look at the dojis and say, oh,
strong bull trends do not have all these dojis so it cannot go higher.&nbsp;In
general, that's true.&nbsp;Breakouts do not have all those small dojis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21:58</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But small pullback bull trends, they do have a lot of small
dojis.&nbsp;And the market is in one of the strongest types of trends you don't
want to be selling.&nbsp;The wider the stop you use on any trade, the higher
the probability is that you make money.&nbsp;When you do lose, you obviously
lose more than with a tight stop.&nbsp;But as a general rule, if you use wide
stops, you're increasing your risk, but you're doing that to increase your
probability.&nbsp;So why stops usually mean higher probability?&nbsp;Tight
stops usually mean low probability of making money.&nbsp;So you know where the
stop is.&nbsp;Initially it's down here and then you see a bull breakout or
somewhere up here.&nbsp;You raise the stop here.&nbsp;After you see three or
four or five bars up, strong breakout, this becomes a major higher low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22:56</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you raise the stop.&nbsp;The strong goals, they see the
doji bars and they see the bare bodies.&nbsp;They know the trend does not look
all that strong, but they also recognize it as a small pullback bull trend
day.&nbsp;They see gaps and negative gaps with a lot of trading range, price
action.&nbsp;And that usually means the market is Going to go higher, small by
bull trend.&nbsp;And they buy for any reason.&nbsp;You can buy reversals up
from bear tops, you can buy stop orders, you can buy at the market.&nbsp;And
then every time you get a reasonably strong breakout, especially with follow
through, you tighten your stop to just below the breakout or just below the
most recent higher level strong breakout.&nbsp;Move the shot from here to
there.&nbsp;Bulls buying above these bars, betting on a bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23:51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you get this breakout, you raise the stop and this
becomes a major higher low.&nbsp;Major because it has both decent bull bars and
it's a new high.&nbsp;One other thought about this is the best looking bull
bar.&nbsp;Probably we got one comparable here, but certainly one of the best
one or two bull bars.&nbsp;And it's occurring late in a bull trend.&nbsp;So
that's an increased risk of exhaustion.&nbsp;Exhausted bulls do not necessarily
sell enough to create a short a bear trend.&nbsp;Usually they do
not.&nbsp;However, they usually do sell enough to create a training
range.&nbsp;So if you start to see a surprise bar like this late in the bull
trend, 30, 40, 50 bars, it's an opportunity to take profits.&nbsp;Sometimes
when you get these small pullback bull trends, they stay above the average price
for a lot of bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24:55</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is maybe 30, 40 bars above the moving
average.&nbsp;That means bulls are really aggressive.&nbsp;They're willing and
eager to pay above an average price for 20 or 30 bars.&nbsp;So what do you
think will happen when it finally gets down to an average price?&nbsp;Well, the
bulls will buy.&nbsp;They've been buying above an average price for a lot of
bars.&nbsp;So if they finally get a chance to buy at the moving average, they
usually take it bars or more than 20 bars.&nbsp;I think of it as a 20 Gap bar
buy setup.&nbsp;And a lot of bulls will place limit orders to buy the moving
average, at least for a scalp.&nbsp;Also, a lot of bulls will look for the
first bear close below the moving average and they'll buy that bear
close.&nbsp;Betting that is a trap and it usually is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25:51</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So here you have a 20 gap or buy.&nbsp;You can buy the
moving average replacement limit order to buy one take above.&nbsp;Or you can
buy these gap bars betting that the trend is so strong you will zoom up to a
new high.&nbsp;Bulls, as I said, try to buy the first bear thing.&nbsp;So the
first time there's a pullback below the low of the par bar, they buy
it.&nbsp;First time there's a break below a minor higher low, they buy it
first.&nbsp;Test of the moving average, they buy it first bear close below the
moving average, they buy it first.&nbsp;Big bear trend bar Below the moving
average, they buy it.&nbsp;Gap bars.&nbsp;As soon as they see bars with a gap
between the high and bar and the moving average, they buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26:37</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They can either buy the gap bar or they can buy the reversal
back up using a stop.&nbsp;And here we have a moving average gap bar gap
between the high of the bar and the moving average.&nbsp;So bulls will buy on a
stop just above the high of that bar.&nbsp;And even though we're getting a lot
of sell offs here, we're still making higher lows and higher high gap
bars.&nbsp;It's a sign that the bulls are losing control and it's a sign of
strong bears.&nbsp;They're able to put a bar completely below the moving
average.&nbsp;So when you get gap bars, you know, bull trend that's going on
for two or three hours.&nbsp;The rally that follows the gap bars usually will
be the final rally before the market attempts a major trend reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27:32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E mini trends from the open bull trend, very strong bull
breakout, pullback and moving up again.&nbsp;When it's this strongly up, I tend
to think of it more as just a breakout and an extended breakout on a higher
time frame chart.&nbsp;I also am aware of the possibility that it could be a
parabolic wedge top small pullback bull trend.&nbsp;Also a trend from the open
bull trend and spike and channel bull trends.&nbsp;Spike pullback channel or
the whole thing is a spike pullback channel.&nbsp;Again, most trends have a
spike and channel trend within them.&nbsp;First pullback in about 15 bars or
so.&nbsp;First pullback in about 15 bars or so.&nbsp;Those will buy it and pull
back.&nbsp;You're going to be thinking that channel will follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28:30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here we got a 14 tick pullback and the first pullback to
the moving average at about 50 bars.&nbsp;Small pullback.&nbsp;Old trends, you
always look for a bigger pullback later in the day.&nbsp;Usually about 50 to
100% bigger.&nbsp;Here we got a 14 tick pullback.&nbsp;And here we have a 31
tick pullback.&nbsp;A lot of bars that do not look particularly bullish.&nbsp;A
lot of small bars, a lot of dojis, a lot of prominent tails, A lack of
consecutive big bull bars closing on their highs.&nbsp;One of the
characteristics of a small pullback bull trend.&nbsp;And then most importantly,
in addition to seeing weak bars, I want to see gaps at least one or two.&nbsp;A
pullback held above breakout point.&nbsp;And again here that's a sign of very
strong bulls.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29:32</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it increases the chances that we'll get some kind of a
measured move up.&nbsp;In fact, here, measured move from the bottom of the bull
trend to the top of this Rally takes us up to about the high of the
day.&nbsp;So from the low of the day to this breakout point measure move
up.&nbsp;This is the US dollar versus the Canadian dollar.&nbsp;And this is the
approximate start of the Asian session and began as a small pullback bull
trend.&nbsp;A lot of weak looking bars, Doji's here, not particularly big bull
bars here, a lot of reversal attempts but it's still a small pullback full
trend.&nbsp;A lot of Doji's common in small pullback bull trends.&nbsp;Look at
the size of the pullbacks.&nbsp;13 pips, 17 pips, 22 pips.&nbsp;They're all
pretty small.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>30:30</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Entire rally went up 115 points and the biggest pullback was
only 22 pips.&nbsp;So very small pullback in the bull trend.&nbsp;A lot of
dois, a lot of prominent tails.&nbsp;The absence of consecutive big strong bear
trend bars, you have to be thinking about small pullback bear trend.&nbsp;Next
you look to see if there are gaps and if there are gaps the days probably a
fairly strongly bearish day.&nbsp;I always take measure the size of the
pullbacks.&nbsp;So 17 pip pullback here, 19 pips here, 14 here and here we fall
140 points and the biggest pullback was only 19 pips over here.&nbsp;Again lots
of dooks like probably a bare leg in a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>31:25</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you start to see gaps you gotta throw out that idea of
a bare leg in the trading range and instead you have to assume small pullback
bear trend and that we're going to work lower.&nbsp;One of the hallmarks of a
small pullback trend is gap formation.&nbsp;So if you start to see gaps yet the
bars do not look particularly strong, you have to assume that the market is
much stronger than what you think.&nbsp;Again you can see we have a gap became
measuring gap and a lot of the bulls get out here.&nbsp;You know the market
continues sideways for a couple of hours.&nbsp;In this video I talk about tight
channels and how they are breakouts on higher time frame charts.&nbsp;You only
want to be buying and tight bull channels, you only want to be selling in type
beer channels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>32:21</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next I talk about small pullback trends which are typically
one of the strongest types of trends and they can last a long time.&nbsp;They
always look bad.&nbsp;They always look like they're forming legs within trading
ranges.&nbsp;But once you start to see gaps, even if the gaps are not
particularly impressive, you have to assume that it's a small pullback trend
and not a leg within our trading range.&nbsp;You I'm Al Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you
