Strategy:&nbsp;</span></u><br>
</b><i>“fireflies.ai transcribed this meeting but I'm wondering if you can
ferret out a price action trading strategy for a day trader in the style of al
brooks' methodology from the following”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on the transcription from Al Brooks' video, here's how
one can craft a day trading strategy using his price action methodology:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Al Brooks' Inspired Price Action Day Trading Strategy:</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Objective:</u> To exploit intraday trends and manage risk
using pure price action analysis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Preparation and Market Context:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Pre-Market Analysis: </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Review the previous day's chart to identify if the market
      ended in a trend or a trading range. Note significant support and
      resistance levels.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Market Sentiment: Check early morning news and futures to
     get a feel for the market's direction at the open.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trading Strategy:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Market Open:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Assess Initial Move: Watch the first 15-30 minutes after
      the open. A strong directional move can indicate the day's trend; a lack
      of direction might suggest a trading range day.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Trading Range or Trend? If the market isn't clearly
      trending, assume it's in a trading range and look for opportunities
      within this context.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Entry Signals:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Breakouts:</li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal>Long Entry: Look for a bar closing above a significant
       resistance or the high of a recent bar, especially if it's much larger
       than prior bars (a breakout). Enter on the close of this bar or the
       confirmation bar (a bar that continues in the direction of the
       breakout).</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>Short Entry: Identify a bar closing below support or a
       recent low. Enter on the close or the next bar confirming the breakdown.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Trend Continuation (Pullbacks):</li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal>In a Bull Trend: Buy on minor pullbacks, typically one
       to five bars, especially in a tight channel where the bulls are likely
       to buy dips. Entry can be at or just above the low of these pullback
       bars.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>In a Bear Trend: Sell on minor rallies, near or just
       below the high of these rally bars.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trade Management:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Stop Losses:</li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal>For breakouts, place stops below the breakout bar for
       long trades or above for short trades. </li>
   <li class=MsoNormal>For pullbacks, stops should be just below the swing low
       in a bull trend or above the swing high in a bear trend.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Profit Targets:</li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal>Use measured moves based on the breakout size or channel
       width. Adjust targets dynamically if the market continues strongly.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Trailing Stops: Implement trailing stops to capture
      profits as the trend continues, allowing for flexibility in capturing
      larger moves.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Exit Strategy:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Trend Exhaustion: Look for signs like multiple failed
      attempts at new highs/lows or significant reversal bars indicating trend
      fatigue.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Exit on Weakness: If the market begins to show signs of
      reversing, especially forming patterns like wedges in a tight channel,
      consider taking profits or scaling out of positions.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Risk Management:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Position Sizing: Adjust based on the day's volatility.
      Smaller positions for breakouts with wide stops.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Daily Loss Limit: Set a loss limit to prevent significant
      drawdowns.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Psychological Aspects:</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Patience: Don't chase the market. Wait for clear signals,
      especially in strong trends where every small pullback isn't necessarily
      a reversal opportunity.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal>Focus on Probability: Understand that small risk often
      means low probability, so align trades with high probability setups in
      line with the trend.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>Key Takeaways from Brooks' Methodology:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>80% Rule: Most breakout attempts in trading ranges fail,
     and most reversal attempts in trends fail. Use this to guide your
     strategy, focusing on trend continuation rather than counter-trend
     trading.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Market Structure: Always analyze the market's structure,
     looking left on the chart for context. Recognize when you're in a breakout
     phase (strong trend) or a channel phase (more controlled moves).</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Trading with the Trend: In strong trends, avoid betting
     against the trend. In a bull trend, only look to buy; in a bear trend,
     only look to sell.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>This strategy encapsulates Brooks' teachings by focusing on
price action, trend identification, and disciplined risk management, tailored
for the fast-paced environment of day trading. Remember, this strategy should
be practiced in simulation or with small positions to get accustomed to its
nuances before full-scale implementation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Exit
Plan:&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>in the context of this video, in as many words as you
think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader EXITS a
position</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
In the second video of Al Brooks' series on trends, he provides a comprehensive
discussion on how traders should exit positions, emphasizing several key
principles:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Exit Strategy Overview:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Protective Stops:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Stops vs. Mental Stops:</b> Brooks strongly
      advocates for using market stops rather than mental stops. He explains,
      &quot;For any trade, whether you're in a trend or in a trading range, you
      should always have protective stops. And they can't be simply in your
      head. They have to be in the market.&quot; This approach ensures that
      traders don't rationalize holding onto losing positions based on hope or
      further analysis after entry.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Placement:</b> </li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>For Breakouts:</b> If you buy above a breakout bar,
       Brooks suggests placing a stop &quot;just below the low of that
       bar.&quot; The idea is that if the breakout is genuine, the price should
       not return below this level.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>For Pullbacks in Trends:</b> The stop should be
       placed below the lowest point of the pullback or at a level where the
       trend's validity would be questioned if breached.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Taking:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Scaling Out:</b> Brooks mentions that in strong
      trends, particularly in breakout scenarios, traders might scale out of
      positions. He notes, &quot;If you're a very skilled trader and you can
      buy back your shorts and then sell again. Buy back your shorts and sell
      again, you'll do fine.&quot; However, he acknowledges this isn't for all
      traders, suggesting that for most, it's better to hold until there's a
      clear signal that the trend is ending.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Targets:</b> </li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Measured Moves:</b> Brooks discusses using a measured
       move for setting profit targets, where the size of the initial move
       (from the entry to the highest point of the breakout or trend
       continuation) might predict how far the price will go. For example,
       &quot;And the odds are whenever you see a breakout that is as big as
       this, it's going to result in some kind of a measured move up.&quot;</li>
  </ul>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Dynamic Exits:</b> He encourages traders to adjust
      their profit-taking strategy based on how the market develops. If the
      market keeps moving favorably, one might choose to let some part of the
      position run with trailing stops or take partial profits at predetermined
      levels.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Exhaustion and Reversal Signals:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Wedge Failures:</b> Brooks talks about how beginners
      might see wedges as reversal signals, but in a tight channel, these often
      fail, leading to trend continuation. An exit should be considered if
      there's a genuine reversal signal, like a strong reversal bar or a
      significant price action change that negates the trend.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>80% Rule Consideration:</b> Given that &quot;80% of
      the reversal attempts will fail,&quot; Brooks advises traders to be
      cautious about exiting on what might appear to be a trend reversal.
      Instead, look for strong evidence of a trend change, such as multiple
      failed attempts at new highs or lows, significant volume changes, or
      clear price action signals.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Aspects:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Overcoming Hope:</b> Brooks warns against holding
      positions out of hope rather than strategy, especially in scenarios where
      the market starts to show signs of reversing. He states, &quot;You cannot
      do that. A breakout is the strongest type of trend,&quot; suggesting that
      once a decision is made to exit, traders should act decisively.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reacting to Market Changes:</b> He emphasizes training
      oneself to &quot;react reflexively&quot; to market changes, implying that
      exits should be automatic responses to clear market signals rather than
      emotional or speculative decisions.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Managing Different Market Conditions:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>In Trading Ranges:</b> Brooks suggests that in unclear
      markets or trading ranges, exits might be more frequent or based on
      smaller gains/losses due to the market's lack of clear direction.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>In Strong Trends:</b> Here, he advocates for patience,
      allowing trades to run with wider stops to capture larger moves, but also
      setting stops to manage risk if the trend shows signs of faltering.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' exit strategy involves a blend of technical analysis
(stops, patterns like wedges), understanding market context (trend strength vs.
range), and psychological discipline (avoiding hope-based decisions). His
approach is not about exiting at a fixed point but adapting to the market's
behavior, using protective stops to manage risk, and taking profits based on
market signals and trend momentum. He stresses the importance of recognizing
when a trend might be ending or reversing, but always with an eye on the
probability that the trend might continue, given the statistics he shares about
reversal attempts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Grok's
350 word Executive Summary of the Video</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>“Now give me your executive summary of the video in 350
words”</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the second video of his series on trends, Al Brooks
delves into the nuances of price action trading, focusing on identifying market
trends versus trading ranges. He explains that if a chart does not clearly
indicate a trend, it's likely in a trading range where both bullish and bearish
arguments hold merit. Brooks introduces the concept of trends having two
distinct phases: the breakout phase, which is the most potent part of a trend,
and the channel phase, where the market trades within a narrower price range
but still follows the trend direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He emphasizes the &quot;80% rule,&quot; stating that 80% of
breakout attempts in a trading range fail, and similarly, 80% of reversal
attempts in a trend do not succeed. This rule underscores the importance of
trading with the trend rather than against it. For instance, in a bull trend,
one should look to buy on minor pullbacks, as these are likely to be failed
bear attempts, while in a bear trend, selling on small rallies is advised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks discusses the psychological aspect of trading, noting
how beginners often focus on minimizing risk with tight stops, leading to low
probability trades. He warns against waiting for pullbacks in strong trends, as
this can result in missing significant moves. Instead, he advocates for
immediate action on breakouts, using stops that respect the market's
volatility, and adjusting position sizes to manage risk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He also touches on the formation of wedges as part of
trends, which can be misleading for beginners who might see them as reversal
points rather than continuation patterns in a tight channel. Overall, Brooks'
strategy revolves around trend identification, capitalizing on breakouts, and
understanding the market's inherent tendency to continue trends longer than
expected, all while maintaining strict risk management.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks
Speaks:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>are you able to look through the transcript at the
references to the specific examples brooks makes, and talk about what he talks
about, how it relates to the context of the whole video--specific to his point
or broader...?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's an analysis of the specific examples Al Brooks refers
to in the transcript, relating them to the broader context of his video on
trends:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Examples Discussed by Al Brooks:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bearish and Bullish Trends:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks mentions, &quot;We're strongly bearish. We're
      strongly bearish again and again. And then we're strongly bullish and
      again.&quot;</b> </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal style='color:black'><b><span style='color:windowtext'>Context:</span></b><span
      style='color:windowtext'> This example is used to illustrate how markets
      can swing from one extreme to another, highlighting the importance of
      recognizing when the market is in a trend versus a trading range. </span>It
      relates to his broader point about the market's tendency to form clear
      trends after periods of indecision or range-bound action.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Lower Highs and Double Bottom:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>He points out, &quot;We're getting lower highs. And if
      this chart continued down, you would say that the bear trend began here.
      Likewise here we got a double bottom.&quot;</b></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> Here, Brooks is teaching how to identify
      the inception of trends within what might initially look like a trading
      range. This example ties directly into his discussion on how every
      trading range contains the potential start of both bull and bear trends. It's
      specific to his point about looking for trend signals within noise.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pullbacks and Small Trading Ranges:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Discussing a chart, Brooks says, &quot;Here there's no
      actual pullback, but it's still pause in a trend. Here is an actual
      pullback and a pullback is a small trading range.&quot;</b></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> This example serves to clarify that even
      within a trend, there are moments of consolidation or pullbacks which are
      essentially mini trading ranges. It's crucial for his broader strategy of
      buying or selling these pullbacks in the direction of the main trend,
      embodying the concept of trading with the trend.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Channel and Bull Flag:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;We're trying to reverse up repeatedly, but the
      channel is very tight. I don't have the lines drawn, but it's a very
      tight bear channel.&quot;</b></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> Brooks uses this to explain how trends
      can form channels where the market might attempt reversals but fail,
      leading to what he calls a &quot;bull flag&quot; in a bear trend. This
      ties into the 80% rule where most reversal attempts fail, supporting his
      strategy of not betting against strong trends.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Example:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>He describes, &quot;Here you could use very small
      stops. The bars are small, the market sideways. Here you now have to use
      a wide stop below that bar, below this bar, probably blow all of the
      bars.&quot;</b></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> This example is pivotal for understanding
      breakouts as the strongest part of a trend. Brooks is highlighting the
      change in risk management from trading ranges to trends, specifically how
      stops must be adjusted for breakouts, which relates to his broader
      discussion on trading breakouts with confidence and proper risk
      management.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Wedge Patterns and Trend Continuation:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks discusses, &quot;Unfortunately, a beginner will
      look at this and they'll keep seeing wedges. Now we got a new wedge. One,
      two, either one of these bars or three, and we're starting to get a
      pretty strong reversal down.&quot;</b></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> This example addresses a common mistake
      by beginners who focus too much on patterns like wedges for reversal
      signals without considering the overall trend strength. It ties into his
      teaching about the 80% rule and how trends often continue much longer than
      expected, advising against premature trend reversal assumptions.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>High Probability vs. Low Probability Trades:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>He explains, &quot;Whenever you have a very small
      risk, you always will have low probability.&quot;</b></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Context:</b> This example underscores a psychological
      aspect of trading where focusing too much on minimizing risk can lead to
      low probability trades. It relates to his broader message of trading with
      the trend and managing risk appropriately by understanding the market's
      momentum rather than just focusing on stop placement.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Implications:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Each example Brooks discusses serves to illustrate his
     core principles: understanding market phases, respecting trend strength,
     managing risk appropriately, and recognizing the psychological pitfalls of
     trading. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>They collectively reinforce his methodology of not
     fighting the trend, using protective stops, and focusing on
     high-probability trades based on clear market signals rather than on what
     might seem like logical but low-probability counter-trend moves.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The examples also emphasize the importance of contextual
     analysis, looking at past price action to predict future movements, which
     is central to Brooks' approach to price action trading.</li>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>I enjoyed what you wrote with what brook says about
trading, in the context of this video. Do you think you could use Brooks'
examples, statements, and quips, to elucidate a contrast of his philosophy
(contrast, list, whatever) between tactics and strategy in regards to the
content of this video?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
Here's a structured comparison between tactics and strategy as discussed by Al
Brooks in the context of the second video in his series on trends:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Trading in Channels:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Buying on pullbacks in tight bull channels
      and selling on rallies in tight bear channels, anticipating that the
      trend will continue.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example:</b> &quot;When the bulls look at all of these
      reversal attempts, what they see is a bull flag for me.&quot; This tactic
      involves recognizing these pullbacks as opportunities to buy in a bull
      trend, expecting the trend to resume.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Immediate Breakout Action:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Acting quickly on breakouts, buying or
      selling at the market when a clear breakout is confirmed.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Statement:</b> &quot;You see this, you know the
      market's no longer in a tight trading range. You need to get long.&quot;
      This emphasizes the tactical need to react swiftly to market signals.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Loss Placement:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Placing stops based on the recent price
      action to manage risk, especially in volatile breakout scenarios.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight:</b> &quot;Your stop is all the way down here,
      so your risk is even greater.&quot; Here, the tactic is to adjust stops
      to account for the current market volatility.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Handling Small Pullbacks:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic:</b> Entering trades on minor pullbacks in
      strong trends, understanding these as profit-taking or consolidation
      rather than reversals.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation:</b> &quot;And as soon as it comes down a
      little bit, other bulls who have been waiting for a pullback are
      buying.&quot; This tactic leverages small pullbacks for entry.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Phase Identification:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Determining whether the market is in a
      trend or trading range to set the overall trading approach.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation:</b> &quot;If it's not particularly clear,
      the chart is in a trading range.&quot; This strategy guides traders to
      adjust their mindset based on market clarity.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading with the Trend:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Emphasizing the importance of trading in
      the direction of the trend, given the high failure rate of reversals.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Philosophy:</b> &quot;80% of the reversal attempts
      will fail.&quot; This strategy underscores the need to align trading
      actions with the market's directional bias.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management Philosophy:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Committing to protective stops as a
      fundamental part of trading, not just for one trade but as a continuous
      practice.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight:</b> &quot;For any trade, whether you're in a
      trend or in a trading range, you should always have protective
      stops.&quot; This strategy is about long-term capital preservation.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability Over Precision:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b> Focusing on trades that offer a high
      probability of success, understanding that small risk often means low
      probability.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Rule:</b> &quot;Whenever you have a very small
      risk, you always will have low probability.&quot; This strategy
      encourages trading based on likely outcomes.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Contrast:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics</b> in this video involve the immediate actions
     traders take based on market conditions like trend strength, channel
     behavior, and specific price patterns. They are about executing trades in
     the moment, responding to what's directly observable in price action.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b> encompasses the overarching approach,
     where Brooks stresses understanding market phases, trading with the trend,
     managing risk broadly, and considering the psychological aspects of
     trading. It's about setting the stage for those tactical decisions, ensuring
     they align with a coherent view of market dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>In essence, Brooks' teachings here blend tactical execution
with strategic thinking, where strategy informs tactics. Tactics are the tools
and maneuvers used daily, while strategy is the blueprint that dictates when
and why to use those tools, ensuring that short-term actions serve long-term
trading goals.</p>

Notes on Video</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Overview</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The &quot;14 B Trends&quot; Educational/Training Session
focused on the essential principles of trading range and trend identification,
emphasizing that when charts lack clarity, they are often in a trading range
where breakout attempts typically fail. Key takeaways highlighted the
importance of contextual analysis by looking left on the chart to identify
trends, along with utilizing protective stops. Participants learned that
breakouts represent the strongest trend phases, where managing risk effectively—by
adjusting position sizes and seizing opportunities in strong trends—is crucial.
The session also warned against low probability trades that counter strong
trends, stressing that markets generally seek to establish fair prices and that
strong trends can extend beyond initial expectations. Overall, traders were
encouraged to buy only in strong bull trends and sell in strong bear trends
while keeping awareness of market dynamics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>what would be the most apropos indicator to use for this
video's content when using it to guide day trading decisions?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Volume Profile</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>describe to me how the volume profile works and how to
use it or interpret it using the al brooks stuff above</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Volume Profile: Explanation and Interpretation Using
Al Brooks' Methodology</u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How Volume Profile Works:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Volume Distribution:</b> Volume Profile displays the
     amount of trading activity (volume) that has occurred at various price
     levels over a selected time period. Unlike traditional volume bars, which
     show volume for each time period, Volume Profile shows volume across price
     levels, giving a horizontal view of volume.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Components:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Point of Control (POC):</b> The price level where the
      most volume has been traded. This is often where the market has found the
      most equilibrium.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Value Area:</b> Represents the range where
      approximately 70% of the volume has been traded, indicating where the
      market has spent most of its time.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>High Volume Nodes (HVNs):</b> Price levels with
      significantly high volume, often acting as support or resistance.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Low Volume Nodes (LVNs):</b> Areas with relatively low
      volume, where price might move quickly if it breaks through due to lack
      of historical interest.</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Using and Interpreting Volume Profile with Al Brooks'
Methodology:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Phase Identification:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Ranges:</b> If Brooks points out that the
      market is unclear, Volume Profile would show a dense concentration of
      volume around certain price levels, suggesting a trading range. Here,
      HVNs indicate where the price has historically been
      &quot;comfortable,&quot; potentially showing where the market might
      return if it's not trending.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trends:</b> In a trend, the Volume Profile might show
      a more dispersed pattern, with volume increasing at new highs or lows,
      confirming the trend's strength. A clear breakout on high volume at or
      near new price levels would align with Brooks' view on breakouts.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakouts:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Confirmation:</b> Brooks notes that breakouts are the
      strongest part of a trend. Volume Profile can confirm these by showing
      increased volume at new price levels. If a breakout occurs but isn't
      accompanied by significant volume at the breakout level, it might be less
      reliable. </li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>POC and Value Area:</b> If the price breaks out of the
      value area, particularly past the POC, it's a strong indication of a
      trend continuation, supporting Brooks' advice to trade with the trend.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reversal Attempts and the 80% Rule:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Volume at Reversals:</b> When Brooks talks about the
      80% rule where most reversal attempts fail, Volume Profile can indicate
      where these attempts might occur. If price moves into an area with little
      volume (LVN) after a trend, it might not hold as a reversal due to lack
      of support or resistance. Conversely, if it hits an HVN, it's more likely
      to act as a significant level.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Failed Breakouts:</b> Volume Profile can highlight
      where previous breakouts have failed, often around LVNs, which supports
      Brooks' warning against trading against the trend based on low
      probability scenarios.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry and Exit Points:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Buying Pullbacks:</b> In a strong bull trend, Brooks
      suggests buying on pullbacks. Volume Profile can show where these
      pullbacks might find support (HVNs), offering entry points with a higher
      probability of trend continuation.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting Trades:</b> When deciding to exit, look for
      price moving into or past significant volume areas like the POC or the
      edges of the value area. This could signal potential exhaustion or a
      significant support/resistance level where the market might react.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stops:</b> Place stops below or above significant
      volume areas, particularly around HVNs, to manage risk effectively, as
      these levels are where the market has shown interest.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Position Sizing:</b> If the volume profile suggests a
      breakout with wide volume distribution, consider smaller positions due to
      the potentially larger stops needed, aligning with Brooks' risk
      management principles.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Context:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal>By showing where the market has been active, Volume
      Profile reduces uncertainty, helping traders align their psychology with
      market reality, which is key in Brooks' approach. It can confirm trends
      or trading ranges, reducing the likelihood of counter-trend trades.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, Volume Profile enriches Al Brooks' price action methodology
by providing visual cues about where traders have been active, thus offering
insights into potential support, resistance, and trend confirmation or denial.
This tool helps traders make decisions that are more in tune with market
dynamics as described by Brooks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is Al Brooks, and this is the second of five videos on
trends in the Brooks trading course.&nbsp;An important point when you're
looking at any chart is that if it's not particularly clear, the chart is in a
trading range.&nbsp;Next I want to talk about how trends can be in a breakout
phase or a channel phase.&nbsp;And the breakout phase is the strongest part of
a trend.&nbsp;And finally, I'll talk about the 80 rule.&nbsp;Markets have
inertia just as trading ranges.&nbsp;And to resist breaking out.&nbsp;80% of
breakout attempts fail within a trading range.&nbsp;When the market's in a
trend, it's constantly trying to reverse.&nbsp;But 80% of the reversal attempts
will fail.&nbsp;Look at this chart.&nbsp;We're strongly bearish.&nbsp;We're
strongly bearish again and again.&nbsp;And then we're strongly bullish and
again.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 01:13 So is the market in a trend?&nbsp;Well, if
it's not clearly in a trend, you have to assume it's in a trading
range.&nbsp;It's making strong bull breakout attempts, strong bear breakout
attempts.&nbsp;So there are good arguments for the bulls and for the
bears.&nbsp;It's one of the hallmarks of a trading range.&nbsp;Whenever the
market is not clear and both the bulls and the bears have reasonable arguments,
the market is in a trading range and you have to trade it like a trading
range.&nbsp;I said that every trading range has both bull and bear
arguments.&nbsp;Well, every trading range also contains the start of both bull
and bear trends.&nbsp;For example, look at this.&nbsp;We're getting lower
highs.&nbsp;And if this chart continued down, you would say that the bear trend
began here.&nbsp;Likewise here we got a double bottom.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane
02:04 Let's say we break above the neckline and go up for a measured move and
start a bull trend.&nbsp;And you look back at this chart and ask yourself where
did that bull trend begin?&nbsp;You would say here.&nbsp;However, at this point
right here, we're still in a trading range.&nbsp;So it has an early bull trend
and it has an early bear trend.&nbsp;In this particular case, we have lower
highs and we also have higher lows.&nbsp;Just as every trading range contains
trends contain trading ranges.&nbsp;Every pullback and pause is a small trading
match.&nbsp;And you can tell that by looking at a smaller time frame
chart.&nbsp;Here there's no actual pullback, but it's still pause in a
trend.&nbsp;Here is an actual pullback and a pullback is a small trading
range.&nbsp;So this is a small trading range.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 02:58 This
pullback is a small trading range.&nbsp;It extended on informed a 10 or a 15
bar trading range, yet we're still in a bull trend.&nbsp;Once a trading range
goes on for 20 bars or so, the probability of a reversal becomes almost as high
as the probability that the trend will resume.&nbsp;I always look to the left
and whatever to the left is, that's what is always going to be slightly more
likely the market will do at some point.&nbsp;So when I'm trading in here, when
I'm looking at the market here, it's confusing.&nbsp;Are the bulls or bears in
control?&nbsp;One of the most recent clearly always in setup was here.&nbsp;The
market was clearly always in law.&nbsp;So all through here the probability is
slightly higher.&nbsp;That will get trend resumption up instead of trend
reversal down.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 03:51 But every bar that gets added to the
trading range reduces the probability for the bulls.&nbsp;And at Some point
after 20, 30, 40 bars, the probability of trend resumption up falls to 50% and
the probability of trend reversal down rises to 50%.&nbsp;I talk about always
in trading.&nbsp;And if the market is clearly always in short, it's far easier
to make money selling.&nbsp;So it's better only to look to sell.&nbsp;We're trying
to reverse up repeatedly, but the channel is very tight.&nbsp;I don't have the
lines drawn, but it's a very tight bear channel.&nbsp;So all of these reversal
attempts are minor, which means they'll lead either to a bear flag or a trading
range.&nbsp;So traders look to sell every reversal down from a
pullback.&nbsp;This bar pulled back above that high, so it's a pullback below
one short.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 04:50 Here we pulled back for a few bars and
it's a short.&nbsp;Here.&nbsp;You can also call it a double top lower
high.&nbsp;And here we pull back for a few bars.&nbsp;So it's far easier to
make money selling when the market is clearly always in short.&nbsp;Also, it's
easier to make money if you swing trade.&nbsp;If you sell for any reason here
or here, it's better not to take quick profits.&nbsp;If you're a very skilled
trader and you can buy back your shorts and then sell again.&nbsp;Buy back your
shorts and sell again, you'll do fine.&nbsp;But very few traders can do
that.&nbsp;And when a channel down is this type, it's far better to take any
short and just hold until there's a clear end to the trend.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 05:37 For any trade, whether you're in a trend or in a trading range, you
should always have protective stocks.&nbsp;And they can't be simply in your
head.&nbsp;They have to be in the market.&nbsp;Let's say you buy above this
bar, you might immediately place a stop here.&nbsp;It's a 50 pullback.&nbsp;A
very strong reversal up high.&nbsp;Two by most bulls will not let it fall below
this bar.&nbsp;And if it does, they'll question whether it's still in a bull
trend.&nbsp;So the bull immediately pushes the stop there.&nbsp;The bears will
look at this and say, oh, were trending up and then we got a bull breakout
above this type of channel.&nbsp;So trying to get a bull breakout above the
type full channel, it's an exhaustion bar.&nbsp;Every big bull trend bar is an
exhaustion bar.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 06:22 And the gap close, the gap between
this close and that high closed it over here.&nbsp;So maybe the bull trend has
ended.&nbsp;And maybe we're in a trading range.&nbsp;Maybe we're in fact in a
bear trend.&nbsp;The bears will look at this as a lower high.&nbsp;Not enough
bars for a major reversal, but certainly enough bars for a minor reversal, the
swing down, and the bears will look at this as a double top below high.&nbsp;In
any case, the bulls who buy here cannot have a protective stock in their
heads.&nbsp;They have to have the spot in the market just below the load this
far.&nbsp;Because sometimes you get this.&nbsp;It happens often or not.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 07:02 And if you don't have that stop there taking you out,
you'll keep coming up with reasons why you should continue to hold on to your
long position, hoping that it will reverse up.&nbsp;And you cannot do
that.&nbsp;A breakout is the strongest type of trend.&nbsp;It can be one bar,
it can be many bars.&nbsp;The bars are really scary for beginners.&nbsp;They
look at this and market's not doing much of anything at all.&nbsp;So it's
pretty peaceful watching it.&nbsp;And then you suddenly have to change your way
of thinking when you see a big bar like this, far bigger than all the prior
bars, 10 times bigger, closing far above the high of all the other
bars.&nbsp;So we're no longer in a tight training range.&nbsp;You're now in a
trend.&nbsp;Very strong bull breakdown, high probability that we're going
higher.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 07:56 But here you could use very small
stops.&nbsp;The bars are small, the market sideways.&nbsp;Here you now have to
use a wide stop below that bar, below this bar, probably blow all of the
bars.&nbsp;It's very easy to miss the trade.&nbsp;You're denying that it's the
start of a trend.&nbsp;Well, chances are it is the start of the
trend.&nbsp;Chances are that means high probability that it's going to continue
higher high probability of a profit if you buy yet stop far below.&nbsp;So risk
is great.&nbsp;And that's always the case.&nbsp;Whenever you see something that
has a high probability of predicting something else, like higher prices, your
risk reward is going to be bad, usually your risk is big because the stop is
far away due to how fast the market moved up.&nbsp;You have to get one.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 08:46 Even if a small position, you have to get long.&nbsp;And
what I talk about in this course constantly is ways to get long.&nbsp;You have
to train yourself to react reflexively.&nbsp;You see this, you know the
market's no longer in a tight trading range.&nbsp;The market has
changed.&nbsp;You need to get long.&nbsp;And you can simply buy
closes.&nbsp;You can buy the close of the breakout bar if you want higher
probability.&nbsp;You wait to see if the next bar has a bull close and then you
buy that bull close.&nbsp;And how do you buy it?&nbsp;You just hit the button,
buy the market.&nbsp;Or you could place a limit order as soon as this bar
closes to buy at the close of that bar.&nbsp;But the easiest thing is you see
that second bar, having a bull close just hit by the market.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 09:29 Again, stop as far away.&nbsp;So you're risking a lot more
money.&nbsp;Have to trade smaller.&nbsp;You can put your stop below the breakout
bar.&nbsp;If this is going to be a successful breakout, it should not trade
below such an exceptional bar.&nbsp;You could also put it below the entire bull
light.&nbsp;Both are reasonable.&nbsp;And the odds are whenever you see a
breakout that is as big as this, it's going to result in some kind of a
measured move up.&nbsp;Maybe simply based upon the open of the bar to the close
of the bar measure move up here.&nbsp;But it certainly has at least a 60%
chance of resulting in higher prices in some kind of measurement.&nbsp;I think
one of the hardest things for a beginner is all they think about is
risk.&nbsp;I can't lose money.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 10:15 I work so hard to
get this account so that I can trade.&nbsp;And if I lose my money, I lose my
trading career.&nbsp;I die.&nbsp;My trading career has died.&nbsp;So all they
focus on is risk.&nbsp;And because of that, they're always looking for the
tightest possible stock.&nbsp;And they're also always waiting for pullbacks
because they think, well, I don't want to buy up here because my stop is too
big.&nbsp;I can't afford the risk that much.&nbsp;While they wait, the trend
can continue up a long way.&nbsp;They have to get used to just buying at the
market.&nbsp;They see the markets going up, tight channel.&nbsp;It's a breakout
on a higher time frame.&nbsp;You just buy at the market.&nbsp;Put a stop down
here, go for a walk for 15 minutes.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 10:58 And if that's
what you have to do to stay in the trend, because this tight bull channel is a
breakout on a higher time frame chart, that means the odds Are we're going
higher?&nbsp;That beginner now, his stop is all the way down here, so his wrist
is even greater.&nbsp;So he's even more afraid.&nbsp;And he's going to keep
waiting for a pullback instead of looking at the chart and saying, wow, this is
going up.&nbsp;And it may keep going up.&nbsp;I should just get long, you know,
the beginner just hoping for that pullback.&nbsp;And this is a whole
rally.&nbsp;If you are a bull and you're long for any reason, let's say you
bought somewhere down here, your stop is down here, and that stop is probably
much bigger than what you typically use.&nbsp;And that means your risk is
greater than normal.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 11:45 So what do you have to
do?&nbsp;Well, if you're a computer algorithm, you have to do something to make
sure that your risk does not get too big.&nbsp;The easiest thing to do is to
reduce your position size.&nbsp;So even in a strong bull trend, bulls have to
take profits at some point to reduce their risk.&nbsp;And when the bulls take
profits, it creates a bull flag.&nbsp;However, beginners don't see it that
way.&nbsp;When they see that pullback, they see a trend reversal.&nbsp;Reversal
into a bear trend.&nbsp;This is profit taking from the bulls, trying to
reverse, trying to reverse.&nbsp;See, it went up and down.&nbsp;Mostly profit
taking from the bulls.&nbsp;It's a mistake to be selling even with limit orders
when the channel is this tight.&nbsp;All of these reversals are mostly profit
taking from the bulls.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 12:34 And as soon as it comes down
a little bit, other bulls who have been waiting for a pullback are buying even
if it drops just one bar below the low, the other bar here, one bar below, one
bar below.&nbsp;Traders who are flat or who do not yet have a full position are
buying even the smallest pullbacks.&nbsp;That means there's a lot of urgency on
the part of the bulls.&nbsp;If you get a big enough pullback, what becomes a
major higher low, Computers will tighten their stops to blow that major higher
low.&nbsp;And then anyone who buys after that point, they have a stock that is
higher up, so the risk is less.&nbsp;So look at this trend.&nbsp;We have one
and two bar pullbacks all the way up, and they do not drop very far.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 13:23 And the market keeps working higher.&nbsp;The sell signal
bars do not look all that strong.&nbsp;When the bulls look at all of these
reversal attempts, what they see is a bull flag for me.&nbsp;And they're
looking for a reversal back up.&nbsp;So they're expecting the reversal down to
be just a bar or two.&nbsp;And the bulls will buy with stops above the reversal
bars.&nbsp;Beer Breakouts.&nbsp;And beginner looks at it and says, oh, it's
still too high for me to buy.&nbsp;I want more of a pullback.&nbsp;The beginner
does not take the trade.&nbsp;He says, you know, my shop still has to be down
here and I cannot risk that much.&nbsp;And what it should be doing is buying
small, just buying a tiniest position that you could buy at any point.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 14:06 Take any one of these high ones, little flags, and use the
appropriate shot.&nbsp;So the beginner ends up missing the trend that goes on
for 10, 20, 30, 40 bars.&nbsp;And the beginner oftentimes start to think, okay,
this is going on way too far.&nbsp;It's unsustainable, it's climactic, and
therefore it should reverse.&nbsp;The trend cannot last forever.&nbsp;All
strong trends are constantly forming.&nbsp;Wedges.&nbsp;One, two,
three.&nbsp;However, when the channel is this tight, all of those wedges are
going to fail.&nbsp;The beginner only sees the wedge.&nbsp;He doesn't see the
tight channel, and he does not see the low probability.&nbsp;So.&nbsp;So that
beginner who did not buy any of this now sees a reversal down.&nbsp;He says,
okay, lower, high, I gotta sell.&nbsp;Maybe we'll get leg one, leg two,
measured move down, leg one, two.&nbsp;And my stop is small.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 15:06 So if I sell below here, maybe my shop is here.&nbsp;So I'm not
risking very much.&nbsp;Yes, he's not risking very much, but is terrible
probability when you have a tight bolt channel like this.&nbsp;The first
reversal down is minor and the bulls will buy it.&nbsp;Here we have a first
reversal down, and guess what?&nbsp;Strong bulls are going to buy it.&nbsp;So
that beginner, who's been waiting for his pullback finally has his fullback,
and he's selling far below the high, far too much below the high.&nbsp;And he's
selling where smart bulls are just waiting to buy.&nbsp;So maybe the beginner
will sell this bear flag and put the stop just above the five bar because he
wants to reduce his risk.&nbsp;And that's just a terrible mistake because most
reversal attempts fail.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 15:55 And this, I think, is a
bull flag and more likely to go up.&nbsp;If it keeps going down for 20, 30 or
40 bars, then the probability is that we're in a bear trend, even though we did
not have a major trend reversal.&nbsp;But at least 70% of the time, you have a
channel this tight and you get a bear breakout, it's going to be a beer leg in
a trading range.&nbsp;And the beers will need a major trend reversal.&nbsp;In
other words, they'll need one more attempt to resume up Testing this high and
then a second entry short double top.&nbsp;There's reversal down and then a
rally, the second reversal done.&nbsp;Without that, chances are any reversal
attempt is going to be minor.&nbsp;The bulls from the buyer 80 rule.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 16:42 If the market's in a strong bull trend, it's always going
to be forming tops, usually wedge tops, but 80% of the tops will fail
here.&nbsp;We got different ways to draw a wedge top.&nbsp;Talked about that a
few minutes ago.&nbsp;And the beginner selling this lower high is betting on.&nbsp;Well,
maybe it's not quite a major reversal, but it's certainly big reversal after a
buy climax and therefore we should fall further.&nbsp;No, that's not
true.&nbsp;Very type old channel, first reversal down.&nbsp;Probably bulls will
buy it.&nbsp;Those were buying one bar pullbacks for 10, 20, 30 bars and now
they get a chance to buy a five bar or 10 bar pullback.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane
17:24 Well, a lot of them will take that chance if they were willing to buy a
one bar pullback and now they get to buy a much bigger pullback and there's no
clear convincing pop they're going to buy.&nbsp;So the bear selling down here
is selling at the bottom of what is at best a trading range and at worst might
be a pullback and a bull trend.&nbsp;Most of these tops become bull
flags.&nbsp;And here you can call this a wedge bull flag, you can call it a
high two, you can call it a small double bottom.&nbsp;Different ways to draw
the wedge.&nbsp;We got a slight pullback here.&nbsp;So first push down in a
doshi, the second push, third push.&nbsp;We can say first push down, second
push down, third push down, doesn't matter.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 18:07 A beer
channel is a bull flag, especially in a bull trend.&nbsp;Bulls are going to be
buying a reversal up from that.&nbsp;Your channel expecting the trench resume
up.&nbsp;So that bear who took this short below that bar and put his top just
above at this yellow line because he did not want to risk much lost money, the
probability was probably 80 that he was going to lose money.&nbsp;So yes, he
took a low risk trade.&nbsp;He did not lose money.&nbsp;But when he takes this
trade, he's going to lose 80% of the time and the 20 of the time that he wins,
he will not manage it well enough to overcome those losses.&nbsp;So the strong
bullshit, the first reversal down is a bull flag.&nbsp;Not every
reversal.&nbsp;Yes, the beginner says, okay, well at least I did not lose much.&nbsp;
S Stephen Crane 19:03 Well, if you lose a little bit of blood a thousand times,
you've lost a lot of blood.&nbsp;These small losses add up and you can end up
losing a lot of money.&nbsp;Now that beginner might think, okay, it's way
overdone and this didn't work.&nbsp;Now we got two legs up here.&nbsp;Maybe
it's a wedge.&nbsp;One, two, three, and maybe a second entry short up here is
worth taking while.&nbsp;It's a credible higher high.&nbsp;Major trend
reversal, bull trend, beer breakout lasting a lot of bars, you know, 10 or more
bars and then resumption up and you got a second leg up from here.&nbsp;This
was likely to have a second leg while we have it.&nbsp;So there are decent
reasons to sell, except one.&nbsp;Very tight bull channel.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 19:52 A very reversal is probably going to be a bull flag and we're going
to resume up.&nbsp;And how big are the pullbacks up here?&nbsp;Really
small.&nbsp;You can also call this a tight bull channel and therefore the
reversal down will probably fail.&nbsp;Even though this is a second entry cell,
first entry, second entry failed breakout, new high.&nbsp;It's still not enough
selling pressure.&nbsp;Where are the big bear bars?&nbsp;Where is the evidence
in the past 20, 30, 40 bars?&nbsp;Where's the evidence that the bears can take
control?&nbsp;This is not much evidence.&nbsp;Yes, it's a short and it's a
reasonable short, but it's a very low probability short.&nbsp;And I would not
take it.&nbsp;I've talked about this before as well.&nbsp;So you're taking a
short, your stop is above this bar.&nbsp;You say, well, at least my risk is
small.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 20:43 Whenever you have a very small risk, you
always will have low probability.&nbsp;In other words, anytime you take any
trade and you're using a very tight stop, you probably are going to get stopped
off for a loss.&nbsp;You can say, well, it's a major trend reversal, so if it
reverses down, I'll get a major profit, a very big profit.&nbsp;And that more
than offsets the low probability, which is true.&nbsp;But it assumes that a low
probability bet will be successful and that you'll manage it
correctly.&nbsp;And most beginners will not.&nbsp;They'll get out with a small
scalp profit, which means they're taking a small reward and that neutralizes
their small risk.&nbsp;So they still have a weak risk reward and they're taking
low probability bet.&nbsp;So low probability and not a strong risk reward setup,
you're going to lose money.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 21:44 What's going to happen
to this bear taking this low risk trade?&nbsp;He's probably going to get
stopped out and he did.&nbsp;Okay, that beginner might keep arguing, well, it's
gonna turn down at some point.&nbsp;It's way overdone.&nbsp;It just cannot keep
going up.&nbsp;Probability has to be getting higher.&nbsp;He knows.&nbsp;Low
probability, low probability, all you cared about was risk.&nbsp;He's assuming
that eventually the probability will go up and that he'll make money.&nbsp;Now
we got a wedge, maybe invested wedge, 1, 2, 3, 4.&nbsp;Nested into a larger
wedge.&nbsp;So that's certainly higher probability.&nbsp;And look, the risk is
small again.&nbsp;So if I sell below that doji, I get filled on this bear bar
and my risk again is small.&nbsp;But small risk usually means low probability
and a pretty tight bull channel.&nbsp;Low probability bulls probably will
buy.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 22:39 It's a credible higher high major trend
reversal short.&nbsp;I would not take it.&nbsp;Just not enough beer bars
anywhere on the screen to be selling, Especially selling with stops too far
below the high.&nbsp;That bear sells below this bar, this nested wedge.&nbsp;He
gets filled right there on this beer bar and he sees this bear.&nbsp;Barney's
happy, thinking that, okay, this is a higher probability short.&nbsp;It might
be, but it's still a terrible short.&nbsp;Chances are bulls will buy that bear
close and that will continue higher.&nbsp;Bulls will either buy the bear
clothes or they'll wait for a bull follow through bar.&nbsp;Bad follow through
a failed bear breakdown.&nbsp;And they'll buy just above that bull bar, betting
that the trend will continue.&nbsp;Like I said, 80% of reversal attempts in
both trends fail.&nbsp;Here, here.&nbsp;Just look at them all.&nbsp; S Stephen
Crane 23:39 Look at all these reversal attempts.&nbsp;Yet the channel up is
tight.&nbsp;There's an absence of big bear bars.&nbsp;The odds are every one of
these reversal attempts will fail and the trend will be going
higher.&nbsp;Unfortunately, a beginner will look at this and they'll keep
seeing wedges.&nbsp;Now we got a new wedge.&nbsp;One, two, either one of these
bars or three, and we're starting to get a pretty strong reversal down.&nbsp;So
maybe I'll sell that close or sell this close.&nbsp;Arguing discipline.&nbsp;I
have to be disciplined.&nbsp;I have to stick to my plan.&nbsp;My plan is that I
have to keep shorting this buy climax because it cannot last forever.&nbsp;And
my losses are small.&nbsp;Losses are part of trading.&nbsp;And certainly each
following reversal attempt will have higher and higher probability because
trends tend to weaken.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 24:28 And here we got a bull
breakup above a bull channel and a reversal down.&nbsp;So that's certainly
higher probability, but it's still a low probability bet.&nbsp;Trends just tend
to keep going up.&nbsp;And it's much better to keep buying bear closes, betting
that the trend will resume back up and that these reversals will fail.&nbsp;So
the beginner sees the bear bar sells here or sells here.&nbsp;Stop just above,
and he gets stopped out.&nbsp;The bull trend is just way too strong.&nbsp;The
pullbacks are too small.&nbsp;They're too brief and it's clearly still always
in one.&nbsp;Traders should only be looking to buy a huge bull trend
day.&nbsp;Yet the beginner lost money because he kept betting against the
trend.&nbsp;Trends are always trying to reverse.&nbsp;They're always forming
witch tops.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 25:19 But they also and go a lot further than
what traders think they possibly can do.&nbsp;So four losses, 1, 2, 3, 4 and
they add up to a big loss.&nbsp;So a trader lost money during a very strong
bull trend because he kept shorting all day, ignoring the low
probability.&nbsp;All he sees is the tight stop and small risk and therefore
I'm going to take the trade.&nbsp;But you need risk, reward and probability to
take a trade.&nbsp;And anytime you're taking a very low probability trade, by
definition, if it's low probability, when it's a high probability loss, you're
going to lose.&nbsp;Most of the time you will lose.&nbsp;So when a trend is
strong, clearly always in one, you should only be buying.&nbsp;Why do markets
exist?&nbsp;They exist for one reason.&nbsp;They allow people to trade at a
fair price.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 26:20 And although you thought the price was
too high, the buyers thought it was too low and it kept going higher.&nbsp;They
need someone to sell to them and you eagerly volunteer.&nbsp;You cannot do
that.&nbsp;Whenever a trend is very strong, you don't want to be the only
person selling.&nbsp;In fact, you don't want to be selling at all.&nbsp;You can
only look to buy.&nbsp;Markets are always trying to make traders
trade.&nbsp;That's part of why they exist.&nbsp;They're trying to facilitate
training, they want more training.&nbsp;So they're always doing things to make
people act.&nbsp;They're always going to be doing something that will make
traders uncomfortable and make them do something.&nbsp;For example, it makes
beginners short all the way up.&nbsp;However, it often has to go very far, much
further than what seems rational.&nbsp;And find out how far too far is.&nbsp; S
Stephen Crane 27:15 And how does it know that buyers stop buying, volume dries
up and one's willing to buy and then it'll start doing the opposite, it'll
start probing down.&nbsp;So as long as you keep selling, you'll have to keep
buying back with a loss and if it cannot go down, is going to keep going up
until there's no one left to buy.&nbsp;Once the final weak bears, like
beginners, stop selling, the strong bears begin to sell and you ultimately do
get a successful top.&nbsp;And there's no evidence of that happening on this
chart.&nbsp;So strong gold trend only with the buy.&nbsp;In this video I talked
about, when a chart looks unclear and you cannot tell if it's in a bull trend,
or a bear trend, it's in a trading range.&nbsp;So anytime something is not
clear, it's a training range.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 28:11 A breakout is the
strongest part of a trend and it's a high probability bet that the Trend will
continue.&nbsp;80 Rule Most reversal attempts fail.&nbsp;80% of reversal
attempts will fail.&nbsp;So instead of selling in a strong bull trend, you should
be buying.&nbsp;Instead of buying in a strong bear trend, you should only be
selling.&nbsp;I'm Al Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you for watching the Brooks Trading
