    <p class=MsoNormal><i>fireflies.ai transcribed this meeting but I'm
    wondering if you can ferret out a price action trading strategy for a day
    trader in the style of al brooks' methodology from the following</i> </p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>Here's a price action trading strategy for day trading,
    inspired by Al Brooks' methodology, based on the transcription provided:</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Al Brooks' Style Price Action Day Trading Strategy:</b></p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding Trends and Channels:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trends</b>: Recognize that trends are the
         foundation of price movement. A bull trend is characterized by higher
         highs and higher lows, while a bear trend features lower highs and
         lower lows. Trends can range from a single bar to the entire chart,
         but focus on major trends, which are typically one or two per chart.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channels</b>: All trends are confined within
         channels. Identify these by connecting swing highs and lows. Channels
         can be very steep or more gradual, but they help in visualizing where
         price action is likely to go next.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Key Trading Concepts:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry Points:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends</b>: Look to buy on pullbacks within a
          bull channel, particularly when the price pulls back to the middle
          third of the last rally. This is an area where bulls tend to step in,
          expecting the trend to continue.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends</b>: In bear trends, seek to sell on
          rallies, especially when price approaches the top of the channel or
          after a failed breakout above a lower high.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stops:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trend Stops</b>: Place your stop loss just
          below the most recent major higher low. This ensures you're out of
          the trade if the bull trend premise is invalidated.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trend Stops</b>: Position your stop just
          above the most recent major lower high to protect against a trend
          reversal.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation and Reversal Signals:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends</b>: If the market breaks above a new
          high, especially with strong bull bars, raise your stop to below the
          new higher low formed. If the market fails to stay above this low,
          consider that the bull trend might be over, potentially entering a
          trading range or bear trend.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends</b>: A breakout below a lower low with
          significant bear bars suggests the bear trend persists. If price
          action reverses above a prior lower low, reassess; the bear trend
          might weaken or transition to a trading range.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Handling Pullbacks and Reversals:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>Expect pullbacks in trends to be opportunities for
          entry or re-entry. For instance, in a bull trend, if a reversal
          attempt fails and price holds above the recent higher low, it's often
          a signal to buy.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal>In bear trends, after a rally fails to surpass a
          prior lower high, it's typically a good spot to sell or short,
          anticipating further decline.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Ranges vs. Trends:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>When trends show signs of weakening (e.g., price
          action not making new highs in bull trends or new lows in bear
          trends), prepare for potential trading ranges. Use these formations
          to adjust your strategy, potentially looking for breakouts or
          breakdowns from these ranges.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Aspect:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>Understand that markets are always trying to reverse,
          but the persistence of higher lows or lower highs within established
          channels indicates the trend's validity. Patience in waiting for
          these confirmations can lead to more successful trades.</li>
     </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal>This strategy involves a lot of visual analysis of chart
    patterns, understanding the market's momentum through bar formations, and
    managing risk with precise stop placements. Remember, the effectiveness of
    this approach relies heavily on accurate trend and channel identification,
    which requires practice and experience to master.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk185532979"><b><u><span style='font-size:
    16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Exit Plan:&nbsp;</span></u></b></a></p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><i>in the context of this video, in as many words as you
    think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader
    EXITS a position</i></p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><br>
    In the context of this video, Al Brooks provides detailed recommendations
    on how traders should exit positions, focusing on several key aspects:</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Loss Placement:</b></p>
    <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Major Higher Lows/Lower Highs:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks underscores the importance of placing stops
          below major higher lows in bull trends or above major lower highs in
          bear trends. For instance, he mentions, &quot;Traders like to put
          their stops below the bottom of the most recent major higher low,&quot;
          emphasizing that stops should be logical according to the trend's
          structure rather than minor movements.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding Minor Reversals:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>He advises against placing stops below minor higher
          lows or above minor lower highs, as these are likely to lead to
          premature exits from a position, especially in strong trends. Brooks
          warns, &quot;Don't put your stock below minor higher lows because too
          often you'll get stopped out and the market will then resume up after
          going below your stop.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
    </ol>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Trailed Stops in Strong Trends:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation:</b> </li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>In strong trends, Brooks recommends trailing stops to
          protect profits without exiting the trend prematurely. For example,
          he says, &quot;If the market reaches a new high or if there's a
          strong bull breakout, I'll raise my stop,&quot; indicating that stops
          should be adjusted dynamically as the trend progresses.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Dynamics:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>He discusses how in a bull trend, after a strong
          breakout, the trend can become broader and flatter. Here, stops can
          be moved to below the most recent significant low within the channel,
          allowing for potential price fluctuations without exiting the trend.</li>
     </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting Based on Trend Reversal Signals:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Validity:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks explains that if the market reverses above a
          major lower high in a bear trend or below a major higher low in a
          bull trend, it might indicate the end of the current trend. For
          example, &quot;If the market falls below a major higher low, the bull
          trend probably has ended,&quot; suggesting that once these conditions
          are met, it's time to exit.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Range or Bear/Bull Reversal:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>He notes that when a trend shows signs of weakening
          or reversing, like not maintaining above a prior lower high in a bear
          trend, the trader should reassess. If the market enters a trading
          range or shows a potential reversal, exiting might be necessary to
          avoid larger losses. Brooks states, &quot;If the market trades above
          a lower high as it did here, it's probably not going to be a bull
          trend, but it could be a weaker bear trend, closer to converting into
          a trading range.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Discipline:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Emotional Management:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>Brooks touches on the psychological aspect of holding
          onto a position too long or exiting too soon due to fear or greed. He
          emphasizes the need for discipline in sticking to the rules of trend
          following and stop placement, &quot;Bulls will buy bear closes&quot;
          because they expect reversals to fail, which also implies they exit
          only when their stop signals are triggered, not based on emotional
          decisions.</li>
     </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Summary of Exit Strategy:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Dynamic Stop Management</b>: Adjust stops based on
         trend progression, not minor pullbacks.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Major Trend Signals</b>: Use significant trend
         reversal signals (major higher lows or lower highs) as exit triggers.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding False Exits</b>: Be cautious of exiting on
         minor fluctuations within a strong trend.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Readiness</b>: Prepare to exit when
         the market logic dictates, not when influenced by emotion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' philosophy is centered around understanding when
    a trend has truly ended or when it's merely in a temporary phase of
    consolidation or pullback. His exit strategy is inherently linked with his
    approach to identifying trends, confirming them through price action, and
    using disciplined stop-loss management to protect gains or minimize losses,
    always in line with the market's broader movement.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><i>Now give me your executive summary of the video in
    350 words”</i></p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><br>
    In this video, Al Brooks discusses key concepts of trend analysis in price action
    trading, focusing on how to identify and trade within trends. He emphasizes
    that trends are characterized by price movements in one direction, with
    bull trends needing higher lows and bear trends requiring lower highs.
    Trends are always contained within channels, which can be steep or gradual
    but are crucial for understanding potential price movements.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>Brooks explains that a trend can span from a single bar
    to the entire chart, but he focuses on major trends, noting that at any
    given time, there should be at most one or two major trends on the chart.
    Minor movements are referred to as swings or legs rather than trends. He
    illustrates and shows to identify these trends by drawing trend lines and
    channel lines, using examples of bull and bear trends.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>For trading purposes, he advises that in bull trends,
    traders should look to buy on pullbacks, ideally when the price reaches the
    middle third of the last rally, and place stops just below major higher
    lows to manage risk. Conversely, in bear trends, selling on rallies near
    the channel's top or after a failed breakout above a lower high is
    recommended, with stops set just above major lower highs.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>Brooks also discusses how to handle trend reversals or
    weakening trends, suggesting that if a market breaks below a major higher
    low in a bull trend or above a major lower high in a bear trend, the
    current trend might end, transitioning into a trading range or potentially
    reversing into the opposite trend. He stresses the importance of not
    placing stops below minor higher lows or above minor lower highs as these
    are less reliable for trend confirmation.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>Overall, the video teaches traders to recognize the
    structure of trends, manage their trades based on trend strength, and
    adjust strategies when trends appear to weaken or change direction.</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk185424683"><b><u><span style='font-size:

    <p class=MsoNormal><i>are you able to look through the transcript at the
    references to the specific examples brooks makes, and talk about what he
    talks about, how it relates to the context of the whole video--specific to
    his point or broader...?</i></p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><br>
    Certainly, let's delve into how Al Brooks uses specific examples in his
    discussion on trends, and how these relate to the broader points he makes
    in the video:</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Examples and Their Context:</b></p>
    <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Chart Analysis for Trend Identification:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example of Bearish Breakout</b>: Brooks uses an
          example of a chart where there are repeated strong bearish moves
          followed by bullish attempts that fail. This example is used to
          illustrate that in a trading range, both bulls and bears have
          reasonable arguments, but since the market isn't clearly trending,
          it's still considered a trading range. This ties into his broader
          point that if a trend isn't clear, it's safer to assume the market is
          in a trading range.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Beginnings within Trading Ranges:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Early Bull and Bear Trends</b>: He discusses how
          within a trading range, there are smaller segments that could be seen
          as the beginning of a trend. For instance, he points out lower highs
          that could indicate the start of a bear trend or higher lows
          suggesting a potential bull trend. This example supports his point
          that trends can emerge from trading ranges, but recognizing these
          early stages requires patience and confirmation.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Trends and Pullbacks:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trend with Pullbacks</b>: Brooks uses an
          example where the bull trend has small pullbacks, emphasizing that
          these pullbacks are often buying opportunities rather than signs of a
          trend reversal. This supports his strategy of buying in strong bull
          trends on minor pullbacks, reinforcing the idea that trends often
          continue longer than expected.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Channel with Failed Reversals:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tight Bear Channel</b>: He discusses a scenario
          where the bear channel is tight, and any bullish attempts are minor,
          leading to either a bear flag or a trading range. This example
          illustrates the 80% rule where most (80% of) reversal attempts fail,
          advising traders to look for selling opportunities in such conditions
          rather than buying.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Bar Example:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strong Bull Breakout</b>: Brooks describes a
          scenario where a market has a small trading range and then suddenly
          experiences a significant bullish bar that breaks out. He uses this
          to explain how trend beginnings can be very volatile, requiring
          traders to adjust their stop placement and risk management. This ties
          into his broader strategy of not just focusing on risk but also on
          the probability of the trend's continuation.</li>
     </ul>
    </ol>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Relation to Broader Points:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding Market Phases</b>: Each example
         serves to illustrate different market phases (breakout, channel,
         trading range), helping traders understand when to expect certain
         behaviors from the market. This is crucial for Brooks' teaching that
         markets are always in one of these phases, and recognizing which phase
         helps in making informed trading decisions.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability and Risk</b>: The examples of failed
         reversals and the 80% rule highlight the importance of probability
         over just risk management. Brooks emphasizes that while risk is
         inherent, understanding the market's tendencies (like the 80% failure
         rate of reversals) can guide better entry and exit points.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation</b>: Through examples where
         trends continue despite seeming overextended, Brooks challenges the
         common trader's mindset that trends must reverse soon. His examples
         show that markets can move much further than anticipated, urging
         traders to ride trends with appropriate stops rather than prematurely
         exiting.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Discipline</b>: The discussion on pullbacks
         and breakout management underscores the need for discipline in
         trading. Brooks uses examples to show that while markets offer many
         opportunities, not all should be taken. The strategic use of stops and
         waiting for confirmation are key elements of his disciplined approach.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal>In summary, Brooks uses specific chart examples to drive
    home his points about market behavior, the importance of trend recognition,
    and the strategic patience required in trading. These examples are not just
    for understanding how to trade specific setups but are woven into his
    broader narrative about market dynamics, trader psychology, and the
    inherent probabilities in trading trends.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks

    <p class=MsoNormal><br>
    Here are some key quotations from Al Brooks about trading calculations and

     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bulls like to buy reversals up at the bottom of
          channels.&quot; This refers to how traders might look for buying
          opportunities when the market approaches or hits the bottom trend
          line in a bull channel.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation</b>:</li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Trends tend to weaken as time goes on... Bulls
          sell at new highs as well to take profits.&quot; This points to the
          behavior of traders within a trend, expecting pullbacks to fail and
          capitalizing on these expectations.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychology of Trading in a Trend</b>:</li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bulls will buy bear closes and they'll use the
          appropriate stops.&quot; This reflects the mindset of trend traders
          who are confident in the continuation of the trend, buying into what
          appears to be bearish activity within the trend.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Handling Minor Reversals in Strong Trends</b>:</li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;If you're a bull trend trader and you see this,
          we have a double top you can call a wedge... Probably the bull trend
          is over and probably the market is either in a trading range or a
          bear trend.&quot; Here, Brooks discusses how traders interpret trend
          signals, especially at potential reversals.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategic Selling in Bear Trends</b>:</li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;Bears are starting to sell new highs,&quot;
          indicating a trading behavior where bears look for opportunities to
          short when the market reaches high points within a bear trend.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Management during Trend Reversals</b>:</li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;If the market trades above a lower high as it
          did here, it's probably not going to be a bull trend... usually the
          best the bulls can get is a trading range.&quot; This illustrates how
          traders adjust their stops based on market movements, particularly
          during potential trend reversals.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Behavior During Failed Breakouts</b>:</li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>&quot;75% of bear channel breakouts where the market
          breaks below the bottom of the bear channel will reverse up to the
          top of the channel or to the top of the most recent sell
          climax.&quot; This quote by Brooks shows a statistical behavior
          pattern traders can expect, influencing their trading decisions.</li>
     </ul>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal>These quotes encapsulate Brooks' insights into how
    traders should behave within trends, focusing on strategic entry points,
    stop placement, and understanding market psychology and statistical

    <p class=MsoNormal><br>
    Certainly! Here's a structured comparison between tactics and strategy as
    discussed by Al Brooks in the context of the video, using his examples,
    statements, and quips:</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics vs. Strategy in Al Brooks' Trading
    Philosophy:</b></p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics:</b></p>
    <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Recognition:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Identifying specific patterns like
          higher lows in bull trends or lower highs in bear trends. </li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quip</b>: &quot;Bull trends need higher lows,
          they're even more important than higher highs, because the higher
          lows determine where traders put their stops.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Price Action:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Reacting to individual bars or small
          sets of bars for entry and exit points within a trend or trading
          range.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;Bulls will buy bear closes and
          they'll use the appropriate stop.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Placement:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Placing stops just below significant
          higher lows or above significant lower highs to manage risk during
          trades.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Statement</b>: &quot;Traders like to put their
          stops below the bottom of the most recent major higher low.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Trading:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Entering trades on breakouts of trend
          channels or ranges.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;A breakout is the strongest
          type of trend. It can be one bar, it can be many bars.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Pullback Buying/Selling:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Buying in bull trends on pullbacks
          within the middle third of the last rally or selling in bear trends
          on rallies near the top of the channel.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Insight</b>: &quot;Bulls like to see these
          reversal attempts... They buy it because they expect the reversal
          attempt will fail.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
    </ol>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b></p>
    <ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Phase Identification:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Understanding whether the market is
          in a trend or a trading range, which dictates the overall approach to
          trading.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quip</b>: &quot;If it's not clearly in a trend,
          you have to assume it's in a trading range.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Following:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Trading with the trend, not against
          it, which means buying in bull trends and selling in bear trends,
          even when it feels counterintuitive due to market noise or minor
          reversals.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Philosophy</b>: &quot;Whenever a trend is very
          strong, you don't want to be the only person selling.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Risk Management:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Implementing stops based on major
          trend characteristics rather than minor market movements,
          understanding the difference between major and minor trend reversals.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight</b>: &quot;A major higher low is one that
          has a very strong bull breakout and usually results in a new
          high.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Probability Over Prediction:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Not just focusing on risk but on the
          probability of market movements, understanding that 80% of breakout
          attempts in a trading range will fail.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Rule</b>: &quot;80% of breakout attempts
          fail within a trading range.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Psychological Discipline:</b></li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Cultivating the mindset to stay in
          trades that align with the trend despite minor adverse movements,
          avoiding the common mistake of trading against the trend due to fear
          or impatience.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;Beginners often focus too much
          on risk... They're always looking for the tightest possible
          stop.&quot;</li>
     </ul>
    </ol>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Contrast:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics</b> are about the 'how' of trading - the
         specific actions you take in response to market movements, like
         placing entry orders, managing stops, and reacting to short-term
         patterns within the trend or range. </li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>, on the other hand, is about the 'why'
         - the overarching philosophy that guides trade selection, risk
         management, market analysis, and trader psychology. Brooks' strategy revolves
         around understanding market phases, the strength of trends, and the
         probability of market movements, which then informs the tactics used
         in trading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' philosophy emphasizes that while tactics are
    crucial for executing trades, the true mastery in trading comes from
    understanding and aligning with the strategic elements of market behavior,
    trend persistence, and trader discipline. His teachings suggest that
    successful trading is not just about knowing what to do at the moment but
    understanding why and when to do it, aligning with the broader market
    trends and phases.</p>

    The educational presentation &quot;14 A Trends&quot; focused on essential
    characteristics of bull and bear market trends, providing a comprehensive
    overview of price movements within trend channels. The first segment
    outlined bull trends, emphasizing the importance of higher lows and the
    role of stop placements below major higher lows following breakouts. The
    discussion then shifted to bear trends, noting the significance of lower
    highs and the tendency for channel breakouts to reverse upward. Finally, the
    lecture addressed trend reversals and trading strategies, highlighting
    traders' responses to market changes and emphasizing the fluid nature of
    trends, as they may shift into trading ranges based on key price movements.
    Overall, the presentation equipped attendees with critical tools for
    analyzing market behavior and making informed trading decisions.</p>

     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>

          reverse&quot; but also highlights the likelihood of these reversals
          failing, which is crucial for understanding market inertia.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Fireflies.ai</b>: Could provide a factual

         emphasis on this helps traders avoid common pitfalls in trend
         analysis.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Loss Discipline</b>: Brooks' constant

         minor higher lows because too often you'll get stopped out,&quot; is a
         key takeaway for risk management.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Continuation vs. Reversal</b>: His insights

         challenge this poses to traders, &quot;Trends tend to weaken as time
         goes on,&quot; is vital for trader development.</li>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Dynamics</b>: Understanding that markets are
         always &quot;trying to reverse&quot; but often fail to do so, which
         Brooks uses as a foundation for his trading strategies, pointing
         towards the importance of patience and confirmation in trading.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>By focusing on these points, traders can better grasp

     <li class=MsoNormal>The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator that

    <p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%'>Using
    Stochastic Oscillator in Trending Scenarios According to Al Brooks'
    Methodology:</span></b></p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Bull Trends:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Higher Lows and Stochastic</b>: In a bull trend,
         where Al Brooks emphasizes the importance of higher lows, the
         stochastic oscillator can help confirm momentum. </li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Look for oversold signals (below 20)</b>: These
          might coincide with price pullbacks, which are common in bull trends.
          If the stochastic moves from oversold back above 20 while the price
          makes a higher low, it could signal the end of the pullback and a
          continuation of the trend.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Divergence</b>: If the price makes a higher low,
          but the stochastic makes a lower low, this bearish divergence could
          warn of a possible trend reversal. However, Brooks would likely
          advise caution here, suggesting that only a break below a major
          higher low would truly indicate a trend change.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Placement</b>: Use the stochastic to help with
         stop placement. If you buy on a stochastic bounce from oversold
         levels, place your stop below the last major higher low, as Brooks
         suggests, to manage risk.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Bear Trends:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Lower Highs and Stochastic</b>: In bear trends,
         where lower highs are critical:</li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Watch for overbought signals (above 80)</b>: These
          might occur during short rallies within a bear trend. A move from
          overbought back below 80 could signal a resumption of the downtrend.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal><b>Divergence</b>: A bullish divergence where the
          price makes a lower high but the stochastic makes a higher high might
          suggest the bear trend is weakening. However, Brooks' methodology
          would still require a breach above a major lower high to confirm a
          trend shift.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Selling Opportunities</b>: Use overbought signals
         to look for short entries, especially if they coincide with price
         action near the top of a bear channel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal><b>Interpreting Reversals:</b></p>
    <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Channel Breakouts</b>: When using the stochastic in
         conjunction with channel analysis:</li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>If the price breaks above a channel line in a bear
          trend with the stochastic moving from oversold to above 20, it might
          hint at a reversal, but only if other criteria like breaking above a
          significant lower high are met.</li>
      <li class=MsoNormal>In bull trends, a drop below the channel line with
          the stochastic dipping into oversold territory might suggest a
          reversal if the price falls below a major higher low.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>False Signals</b>: Both Brooks and the stochastic
         oscillator warn against false signals:</li>
     <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
      <li class=MsoNormal>In strong trends, the stochastic might remain in
          overbought or oversold conditions longer than expected. Brooks
          advocates for understanding the market context; hence, one shouldn't
          trade based solely on the oscillator but should look for confirmation
          through price action, like channel integrity or trend line breaks.</li>
     </ul>
     <li class=MsoNormal><b>Combining with Other Indicators</b>: Brooks often
         discusses combining various forms of analysis for confirmation. The
         stochastic can be used alongside trend lines, support/resistance, and
         Brooks' focus on higher lows or lower highs to filter out noise and
         confirm potential reversals or continuations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class=MsoNormal>By integrating the stochastic oscillator with Al Brooks'
    price action methodology, traders can enhance their analysis of market
    momentum, trend strength, and potential reversal points, always considering
    the broader market context and trend structure.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Finally, bear trends need lower highs in a
    trend.&nbsp;Prices move mostly in one direction.&nbsp;So here, lower left,
    upper right, even though the market went sideways for a couple of
    times.&nbsp;Also, trends are contained within channels.&nbsp;All trends are
    contained within channels.&nbsp;Some channels are very steep, but the
    channels are there.&nbsp;There's a trend line below and the trend channel
    line above.&nbsp;The trend channel line can be simply a parallel of this
    line, or you can draw the line connecting tops.&nbsp;Now I said every trend
    is contained in a channel.&nbsp;The channel might not be all that obvious,
    but it's there and it's important to learn how to recognize it.&nbsp;This
    is a bull trend bar.&nbsp;Bull trend bar.&nbsp;A trend can be as small as a
    single bar and it could be as large as the entire chart.&nbsp; S Stephen
    Crane 01:07 Here we had a trend lasting two bars going up and then many
    bars going down.&nbsp;When I use the word trend, I'm talking about a major
    trend, even though I don't always say major.&nbsp;And there are at most one
    or two of them on the chart at any one time.&nbsp;If you see three or four
    trends on the chart, those trends are minor, and I usually don't use the
    term trend to describe them.&nbsp;I usually refer to them as swings or
    legs.&nbsp;Here we have a bull trend.&nbsp;Is this a bear trend?&nbsp;I
    would call it more of a bear swing.&nbsp;It's about a 50% pullback of this
    bull trend.&nbsp;Plus it's much less strong than the bull trend.&nbsp;And
    this is a bull trend.&nbsp;Again, I would call it a swing.&nbsp; S Stephen
    Crane 01:54 It's less than half of the bars on the chart and it's not particularly
    strong.&nbsp;So to me, this is a bull trend followed by a bear swing and a
    bull swing.&nbsp;I said that a bull trend and higher lows, and it's
    contained within a rising channel.&nbsp;The bottom line is the trend line,
    the bull trend line, and the top line is the trend channel line, trend
    line, channel line.&nbsp;Some people refer to both as trend lines.&nbsp;So
    some people say this is the bottom trend line.&nbsp;That's the top trend
    line of the channel.&nbsp;I usually refer to the upper line as the trend
    channel line.&nbsp;In general, traders like to put their stops below the
    bottom of the most recent major higher low.&nbsp;Here we have a major
    low.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 02:56 We don't know if it's a higher low, but
    it's certainly the start of this bull trend.&nbsp;And traders like to put
    their stops just below there if they're buying.&nbsp;Is this a major higher
    low right here?&nbsp;No, I talked about this in earlier videos.&nbsp;A
    major higher low is one that has a Very strong bowl breakout and usually
    results in a new high.&nbsp;And this did not get to a new high.&nbsp;And it's
    not a very strong bull breakup.&nbsp;So it's a minor higher low right
    here.&nbsp;And that is not a good location for a stop.&nbsp;You still keep
    the stop down here.&nbsp;Whether you're swinging or scalping, your stop is
    down here.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 03:41 Again, don't put your stock below
    minor higher lows because too often you'll get stopped out and the market
    will then resume up after going below your stock stop below here, here, all
    are bad stops.&nbsp;The correct stop is down here.&nbsp;Again, it doesn't
    matter if you're swing trading or scalping.&nbsp;This is where your stock
    goes below the bottom of the last strong leg up.&nbsp;So if you put your
    stop below this bar or below that bar or below this bar, you would have
    been stopped out, yet the trend would have continued.&nbsp;This is not
    enough to change the premise that the market is in a bull trend.&nbsp;It's
    a pullback.&nbsp;You can call it a trading range, but it's still in a bull
    trend.&nbsp;I'll raise my stop if the market reaches a new high or if
    there's a strong bull breakout.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 04:45 One bar usually
    is not enough.&nbsp;But here we got a couple decent bull bars and a new
    high, and this low followed.&nbsp;These lows went to a lower low.&nbsp;Most
    fools would conclude that if we go to a new high and drop below this low,
    we're no longer in a bull trend.&nbsp;We're not necessarily in a bear
    trend, but the bull trend has ended.&nbsp;Traders would then view the chart
    as being either in our trading range or possibly in a bear trend.&nbsp;This
    is a good location for a stop after you have this full breakout.&nbsp;A lot
    of traders might still keep their stop down here, but most would
    not.&nbsp;After you get a new high with a couple decent bull bars and
    you're getting a failed breakout below the trading range.&nbsp; S Stephen
    Crane 05:29 That combination of factors is enough to make this a major
    higher low.&nbsp;And the bulls should not allow the market to fall below it
    if the premise of a bull trend is still valid.&nbsp;I said that if the
    market falls below a prior higher low, it may be converting into the
    trading range or bear trend.&nbsp;But if it falls below a minor higher low
    like this, all it's doing is converting into a flatter full channel, a
    broader, flatter bull channel.&nbsp;We have a very tight bull channel here,
    but at this point we start going up.&nbsp;The channel now is broader and
    flatter.&nbsp;This is what I mean.&nbsp;I mentioned that bull trends need
    higher lows.&nbsp;They're Even more important than higher highs, because
    the higher lows determine where traders put their stops.&nbsp; S Stephen
    Crane 06:37 So if the market falls below a prior higher low here, below
    here, it can still be a bull trend, but it might be a broader, flatter,
    weaker bull trend, closer to converting into a trading range.&nbsp;And it's
    possible that it could even be converting into a bear trend.&nbsp;Typically
    though, when you have a trend that strongly up, it's not going to go
    directly into a bear trend that usually first has to convert into a trading
    range.&nbsp;So we got a strong bull breakout to a new high.&nbsp;So this
    then becomes a major higher low once you see this.&nbsp;Bulls raise their stock
    from here to there.&nbsp;So they trail their stock, they tighten their
    stock.&nbsp;This is not going to convert into a trend in the opposite
    direction by falling straight down.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 07:33 Probably
    the best the beers get is a trading range and they usually typically need
    at least a small double top.&nbsp;If you're a bull trend trader and you see
    this, we have a double top you can call a wedge.&nbsp;One, two, no bull
    bar, some more beer bars.&nbsp;So now you have six bars down, five beer
    bars and you fell below a major higher low.&nbsp;Probably the bull trend is
    over and probably the market is either in a trading range or a bear
    Trend.&nbsp;It's about a 50 pullback from this rally.&nbsp;So the bulls
    will stop themselves out as the market falls below that low.&nbsp;However,
    it's still probably at least a trading range.&nbsp;The bears probably will
    need a major trend reversal if they're going to convert it into a bear
    trend.&nbsp;And that's what they got.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 08:24 They got
    a wedge lower high, three pushes up, 1, 2, 3 wedge lower high, decent sell
    signal bar.&nbsp;And they converted it into a bear trend.&nbsp;It still
    could be a large high to buy like one pullback, two, it's holding above
    this low.&nbsp;But I think most bulls get out below that low or above this
    bull bar and bears would short somewhere in here or they were short this
    wedge lower high for swing down bull trend.&nbsp;In this case, it's a
    fairly broad bull channel.&nbsp;We have higher highs all the way
    up.&nbsp;We have higher lows all the way up.&nbsp;And after each strong
    breakout to new high, bulls will raise their stop to below the most recent
    higher low.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 09:14 And you can see after each strong
    breakout to a new high, when there's a pullback, it did not fall below the
    most recent higher low.&nbsp;This did not fall below that.&nbsp;And then a
    strong breakout to a new high, major higher low.&nbsp;Market tried to
    reverse down, terrible follow through.&nbsp;It became a bear trap and the
    bull trend resumed so each reversal attempt held above the most recent
    prior higher low.&nbsp;That's one of the hallmarks of a bull trend.&nbsp;In
    a broad bull channel like this, you often have pretty strong sell
    offs.&nbsp;We have many of them here.&nbsp;And sometimes the sellers are
    even strong enough to convert the market into always in short, in other
    words, an early bear trend.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 09:59 However, unless the
    bears are able to get below major higher lows, even if it becomes briefly
    always in short, the odds are the bull trend will continue.&nbsp;I would
    say that this market was not short.&nbsp;I think even though we had
    pullbacks here, 10 bars, 15 bars, I think it stayed always in long because
    the bears failed to get consecutive big bear trend bars.&nbsp;They have two
    bear bars here, but a tail and followed by a bull bar.&nbsp;So to me, this
    is not enough to convert the market to always in short, sometimes when you
    have a broad bull channel, the market will sometimes become always in
    short.&nbsp;Yet the market can still be in the broad bull channel.&nbsp;I'm
    always drawing lines on charts.&nbsp;You start with what you have in front
    of you, add it to the right.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 10:50 You have to adjust
    your lines.&nbsp;The lines are rarely ever perfect.&nbsp;At this point, I'm
    using these lines, but then the market falls below here.&nbsp;Then I use
    this point for my line.&nbsp;But it's still a bull trend.&nbsp;It's just
    flatter.&nbsp;It's not as vertical.&nbsp;And it's also broader at that
    point.&nbsp;So you can see here, we fell below the blue line, so now we
    have a new low.&nbsp;Market rallies.&nbsp;This is now my trend and we fell
    below that line.&nbsp;So when it starts up, I'll replace this line with one
    down here.&nbsp;And when you get to the bottom of channels, bulls like to
    buy reversals up.&nbsp;So they buy about this bar and they buy above that
    bar or this bar.&nbsp;I said that we had reversal attempts repeatedly in
    this broad bull channel.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 11:44 None of them was
    strong enough to convert the trend to always in short.&nbsp;And the bulls
    expect all of these reversal attempts to fail.&nbsp;So when they see a bear
    reversal attempt, what are they doing?&nbsp;They're buying.&nbsp;Anytime
    there's a broad bull channel and it pulls back somewhere into the middle of
    the last leg up pulls by.&nbsp;Okay, we have a rally pull back somewhere in
    the middle third, bulls buy.&nbsp;A rally pulls back to the middle third of
    the that last rally buy rally pull back somewhere into the middle of that
    rally, we'll start looking to buy.&nbsp;And then they tend to take partial
    profits at new highs.&nbsp;And that's what in part creates the pullbacks
    and bears See something really important.&nbsp;So let's say you're a bear
    and you see this right here.&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 12:29 A new high
    and a pullback that fell below this high.&nbsp;Well, what are you going to
    do if you're a bear?&nbsp;Well, you'll see this high.&nbsp;You're going to
    place a limit order to sell at that high, betting that will drop back down
    below the sign because that's what we did before.&nbsp;And trends tend to
    weaken as time goes on.&nbsp;So bulls are buying pullbacks to the middle
    third of the last leg up.&nbsp;So they buy somewhere in here.&nbsp;And
    bears are starting to sell new highs.&nbsp;And bulls sell at new highs as
    well to take profits.&nbsp;And bulls like to see these reversal
    attempts.&nbsp;As long as the market's continuing to make higher lows, they
    assume the trend will continue.&nbsp;So whenever they see a reversal
    attempt like this or that or this, guess what?&nbsp;Guess.&nbsp; S Stephen
    Crane 13:14 They buy it because they expect the reversal attempt will
    fail.&nbsp;So the bulls will buy bear closes and they'll use the
    appropriate stock.&nbsp;A bull buying this close, the stop is below the
    most recent major higher low.&nbsp;And he bet that the bear reversal would
    fail and that the trend up would continue.&nbsp;Same with him.&nbsp;You
    could buy that close.&nbsp;You could buy below that bull bar because it's a
    bad looking sell.&nbsp;You can buy that bear close.&nbsp;Another attempt to
    reverse, you buy back close.&nbsp;I wouldn't draw this as a trend line here
    and extend it across.&nbsp;However, either one of these you can use for the
    first point of a line.&nbsp;And then here's an obvious second point.&nbsp;
    S Stephen Crane 13:58 We reverse down and to find the bottom of the
    channel, you could either simply use lows like draw a line from here to
    here, or you can use a parallel line.&nbsp;At this point, we know the
    market was turning down here.&nbsp;Maybe it'll fall to the bottom of the
    channel that is created from a parallel level.&nbsp;Once we start to turn
    down here, a lot of traders can see an obvious top of a channel and they'll
    create a parallel of it and drag it down to a bar that contains all of the
    bars.&nbsp;Would I drag it to this bar?&nbsp;No, because these bars would
    then below the channel.&nbsp;I want to drag it down to the bar.&nbsp;That
    would result in the channel containing all of the bars.&nbsp;And then
    traders will look to buy a reversal up.&nbsp;Channels are rarely
    perfect.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 14:49 There's usually some problem with
    every channel.&nbsp;But it gives you an idea of what the market's trying to
    do.&nbsp;And if the market's near the bottom of the channel, traders look
    to buy for a reverse loss.&nbsp;And if it gets near the top of a channel,
    they look to sell for a pullback.&nbsp;Just like a bull trend needs higher
    lows, a bear trend needs lower highs.&nbsp;Bear trend has lower highs and
    lower lows and is contained in a falling channel right here.&nbsp;So here
    we have a spike down a pullback and then a bear channel.&nbsp;Now this is a
    major lower high.&nbsp;We have a reasonably strong breakout to a new
    low.&nbsp;A lot of bears will put their stops above that high and I cannot
    tell if this went above that.&nbsp;It looks like it might have.&nbsp; S
    Stephen Crane 15:42 And if a bear did exit on a stop above that bar, he
    would look to sell again on a reversal down because of a possible double
    top bear flag.&nbsp;So double top bear flag neckline, looking for a
    measured move down.&nbsp;The top of the channel is the bear trend line and
    the bottom is the channel line.&nbsp;So be trend channel line.&nbsp;In a
    bear trend, bears want to put their stops above the top of some major sell
    off.&nbsp;Here we have a very strong bear breakout.&nbsp;So bear selling
    anywhere this close at the market above this bar, below that bar, doesn't
    matter.&nbsp;Their stop is still above this high.&nbsp;So it's above the
    most recent major high.&nbsp;Let's say we're at this point.&nbsp;Is this a
    major high?&nbsp;Will bears lower their stops from here to here?&nbsp;I
    don't think so.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 16:43 That's not particularly strong
    bear breakout and did not get down to a new low.&nbsp;The bears who shorted
    for any reason still have their stop up here because they know since this
    is not a major low, the market could easily go above it and still be in a
    bear trend.&nbsp;So you get a low two or a wedge bear flag.&nbsp;So we get
    one more slightly higher high, another slightly higher high and still be in
    a rare trend.&nbsp;If you're selling for any reason, your stop is above the
    top of this major sell off.&nbsp;This is a bad location for a
    stop.&nbsp;Like I said, you could easily get two legged pullback, one
    pullback and then two going above that minor lower high and then the bear
    trend could resume down from below.&nbsp;Two bear flag.&nbsp;And that's
    what happened.&nbsp;One pull back too.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 17:39 We have
    a two legged bear fly below, two short double top bear flag, decent sell
    signal mark a bear who sold down here, anywhere in here and then put a stop
    just above that lower high.&nbsp;Lost money in a bear trend.&nbsp;And if
    the bear made that mistake, he should get short again as the bear trend
    resumes down.&nbsp;So he would sell again below that bear bar.&nbsp;Now
    here we have a low two bear flag, failed breakout, a failed reversal
    attempt and then we broke out fairly strongly to a new low.&nbsp;At this
    close, a lot of the bears will tighten their stops.&nbsp;They'll say, oh,
    this is pretty major.&nbsp;We got a new low and we have a pretty decent
    bear bar.&nbsp;And that's after trying to reverse up.&nbsp;So the market should
    not get above this bar.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 18:32 If it gets above this
    bar, then the premise of the bear trend is probably no longer
    valid.&nbsp;The market would then either be in a trading range or in a bull
    trend.&nbsp;And if you're trading it like a bear trend and it has become a
    trading range or a bull trend, you want to get up because your premise of a
    bear trend is no longer valid.&nbsp;So after a strong breakout, this
    becomes a major lower high.&nbsp;And bears will take their stock from here
    and put it to just above there.&nbsp;Pretty tight channel.&nbsp;And if the
    market trades above a lower high as it did here, it's probably not going to
    be a bull trend, but it could be a weaker bear trend.&nbsp;It could be a
    trading range, but more likely it's going to be a weaker bear
    trend.&nbsp;Broader bladder.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 19:26 So initially we
    had this as the bear trend, very tight.&nbsp;And then once we have this
    lower high, we can draw a line here, still pretty tight.&nbsp;And now we
    have a new high above both of those possible bear channels.&nbsp;So now we
    have a new channel from this high to that high, and it's broader and
    flatter than the other channels.&nbsp;Here we got a bear micro
    channel.&nbsp;So it's a breakout on a higher time frame chart.&nbsp;And we
    have a series of lower highs and lower lows.&nbsp;Is this a major lower
    high?&nbsp;Probably is.&nbsp;Had a pretty strong bear breakout and follow
    through and it made a new low.&nbsp;And then also we're trying to get a
    bear breakout below a bear channel.&nbsp;So if you connect these lows, that
    would create a bear channel.&nbsp;And here we're trying to break below
    it.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 20:16 That's not a good thing.&nbsp;75 of beer
    channel breakouts where the market breaks below the bottom of the bear
    channel.&nbsp;75 of them will reverse up to the top of the channel or to
    the top of the most recent cell climax.&nbsp;This bar may be that
    bar.&nbsp;But in any case, if you're short and you are going to exit on a
    stop, your stop now is above this bar or above that bar.&nbsp;Both of those
    are reasonable.&nbsp;And what happens if you get stopped off?&nbsp;Is it a
    bull trend?&nbsp;No, a tight bear channel like this usually cannot then
    become a bull trend.&nbsp;Usually the best the bulls can get is a trading
    range.&nbsp;And if the bears are unable to resume the trend down, the bulls
    have a shot at a major trend reversal within that trading range.&nbsp; S
    Stephen Crane 21:04 And at that point, the probability of the bulls taking
    control is better.&nbsp;Usually the first breakout of a channel results in
    a minor reversal in a trading range or a bear flag rather than a bull
    trend.&nbsp;The bears get stopped out here and a strong gold bar and a
    pretty good reversal.&nbsp;Strongly down, strongly up.&nbsp;Probably a
    minor reversal.&nbsp;Some bears will sell below this bar on the failed
    breakout above these bars.&nbsp;Others will wait to see if we get a series
    of bear bars, three or four bear bars and then sell.&nbsp;Or if we get a
    micro double top strong enough bull bar, probably at least a minor second
    leg up likely.&nbsp;And in this particular case, we got a particularly
    strong leg up.&nbsp;It went above all of the highs in the channel.&nbsp; S
    Stephen Crane 21:53 Did not get above the top of the bull trend.&nbsp;So
    what do you do?&nbsp;Not a lot of traders would sell below that
    bar.&nbsp;Two legs up, one, two or a wedge.&nbsp;One or one and then two,
    three or one, two, three different ways to draw it.&nbsp;We'll look at this
    as a possible second leg trap in a developing trading range.&nbsp;First leg
    up, pull back, second leg up.&nbsp;Terrible follow through and pretty bad
    follow through.&nbsp;And we did not get above this high.&nbsp;So this is
    probably a bullet in a trading range.&nbsp;A lot of bears will sell that
    and the bulls probably would get out because disappointing follow
    through.&nbsp;Despite a strong gold breakout.&nbsp;All trends are
    constantly trying to reverse.&nbsp;So here we have a bear trend.&nbsp;Lower
    highs, lower lows.&nbsp;Constantly trying to reverse.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane
    22:44 And sometimes the reversal up is strong enough to make the market
    always in long.&nbsp;Here we have a bull breakout above this lower high and
    a follow through bar, tail on top.&nbsp;Not especially big, but probably
    always in lawn.&nbsp;Pretty common when you're in a broad bear channel for
    the market to become always in long.&nbsp;However, usually the bear trend
    resumes before the market gets above major lower high.&nbsp;Like this or
    like that.&nbsp;Even though the market rallied up strongly, especially
    here, in many attempts to reverse up, every rally resulted in a lower
    high.&nbsp;So it's still a bear channel.&nbsp;And traders will look to sell
    the reversal down.&nbsp;Now you have a beer bar and a follow through
    bar.&nbsp;Bear bar.&nbsp;Do you put the stop above this high or above that
    high?&nbsp;No, this is a minor lower high.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 23:37 Did
    not have a strong bear breakout.&nbsp;Did not get to a new low.&nbsp;And
    therefore putting a stop just above the high of that bar is a low
    probability bet.&nbsp;You're throwing money away.&nbsp;You still have to
    rely on your swing saw.&nbsp;Now what about this?&nbsp;Is this a good
    enough major lower high?&nbsp;So bears can put their stops above
    it.&nbsp;Maybe this is not a strong beer breakout, but it is a new
    low.&nbsp;A lot of bears will not put their stuff up here.&nbsp;They'll
    keep the stop up here.&nbsp;If the bears do put their stop just above this
    bar and they get stopped out here, they'll look to sell a reversal down
    either below either of these bars or below here, betting that the rally
    does not look strong.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 24:18 It looks more like either
    a bull leg in a trading range or a bull leg that becomes a bear
    flag.&nbsp;Bears, they see these strong rallies and they say, yeah, it's a
    strong rally, maybe it's even always in one.&nbsp;But it did not get above
    the top of this majority lower high and therefore it's probably going to
    fail.&nbsp;Become a bear flag.&nbsp;So bears will look to sell.&nbsp;The
    same with here.&nbsp;You say, oh, we rallied for 15 bars.&nbsp;That's
    pretty bullish.&nbsp;It is, but it lacked consecutive big bull
    trend.&nbsp;Bars closing in their highs.&nbsp;And it did not get above the
    most recent major lower high.&nbsp;So bears will be selling here
    again.&nbsp;Channels are really perfect.&nbsp;Can see the way I drew
    it.&nbsp;I connected this high and that high and ignored this bar going
    slightly above.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 25:09 And we're trying to go slightly
    above again.&nbsp;Traders don't really care if it hits the
    channel.&nbsp;Exactly.&nbsp;And turns down.&nbsp;They care that it turns
    down somewhere around the channel.&nbsp;So bears are looking to sell on a
    reversal down from the channel.&nbsp;The top of the channel, somewhere
    around the channel.&nbsp;A lot of traders prefer to sell below bare
    bars.&nbsp;So some traders would sell below this bear bar, others would
    take the short below this doji bar.&nbsp;And same over here, you could sell
    below that bull bar or below the bear bars.&nbsp;And here you can sell
    below the doji.&nbsp;You can sell below the bear bar.&nbsp;In this video I
    talked about how I use the term trend.&nbsp;I also talked about the
    importance of bull trends needing higher lows and the importance of bear
    trends needing lower highs.&nbsp; S Stephen Crane 26:05 As long as the bear
    trend is forming lower highs, traders believe the premise of a bear trend
    is still valid.&nbsp;If the market gets above a lower high and a bear
    trend, the bear trend probably has ended and has evolved either into a
    trading range or less likely a bull trend.&nbsp;And the opposite is true of
    a bull trend forming higher lows.&nbsp;If the market falls below a major
    higher low, the bullshit probably has ended and has probably converted into
    a trading range.&nbsp;This is Al Brooks.&nbsp;Thank you for watching the
    Brooks training course.&nbsp;This is the first of five videos on
    trends.&nbsp;The recording.</p>
