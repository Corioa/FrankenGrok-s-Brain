<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Grok's
Strategy:&nbsp;</span></u><br>
</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Based on the transcription provided, here's a summary of Al Brooks' methodology
for price action trading, particularly for day traders:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Al Brooks' Price Action Trading Strategy:</b></p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding Breakouts:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Definition</b>: A breakout is identified by a trend
      bar or series of trend bars moving beyond support or resistance. This can
      be a single bar or multiple bars.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Key Indicators</b>: Look for breaks above or below
      previous highs, lows, trend lines, moving averages, or any other
      significant levels like double tops/bottoms or head and shoulders
      patterns.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The 80% Rule:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Principle</b>: Approximately 80% of breakouts fail.
      This means traders should be cautious when expecting a breakout to
      continue in the direction of the trend.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Implication</b>: Since most breakouts fail, traders
      should consider selling on strong bull closes (bearish strategy) near the
      top of a range or buying on strong bear closes (bullish strategy) near
      the bottom.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Every Reversal is a Breakout:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Concept</b>: Each time the market reverses, it breaks
      out from the previous trend. Thus, every reversal should be treated as a
      potential new breakout in the opposite direction.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trading Within Ranges:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Since markets tend to stay within ranges
      80% of the time, traders should focus on buying low and selling high
      within these ranges.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Scalping</b>: Given the high failure rate of
      breakouts, traders often engage in scalping, taking small profits from
      minor movements within the trading range.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Bars and Follow Through:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Observation</b>: Only about 10% of bars on a chart
      will have significant follow-through, meaning most trend bars will not
      lead to substantial moves.</li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Action</b>: Look for consecutive trend bars for
      stronger signals, but be prepared for these to fail as well.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Practical Trading Actions:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Buying/Selling at Breakouts</b>: </li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Buy</b>: On pullbacks after a failed bear breakout,
       especially if there's a higher low or a bullish setup like a bull flag.</li>
   <li class=MsoNormal><b>Sell</b>: On pullbacks after a failed bull breakout,
       particularly if there's a lower high or a bearish setup like a bear flag.</li>
  </ul>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Losses and Entries</b>: </li>
  <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=square>
   <li class=MsoNormal>Place stops just beyond the critical support or
       resistance levels broken by the breakout. For buying, this might be
       below the low of the breakout bar; for selling, above the high.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Inertia:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Behavior</b>: Markets have inertia; they tend to
      continue doing what they've been doing (trading within a range or
      following a trend) until proven otherwise.</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Avoiding Hopeful Trading:</b></li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Caveat</b>: Avoid buying into breakouts just because
      they look strong, especially in a trading range environment. Instead, use
      these for potential counter-trend trades if the breakout fails.</li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This strategy, condensed from Al Brooks' teachings,
emphasizes the importance of understanding market context, recognizing the high
probability of breakout failures, and trading within the probabilities
established by his 80% rule. It involves a lot of patience, waiting for clear
signals of trend continuation or failure, and managing positions with tight
stop losses due to the volatile nature of price action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Exit
Plan:&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>in the context of this video, in as many words as you
think you need, please discuss in detail how Brooks recommends a trader EXITS a
position</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
In the context of the video transcript, Al Brooks provides several detailed
recommendations on how a trader should exit positions, mainly focusing on the
nature of breakouts, reversals, and the inherent probabilities of market
movements. Here's how he suggests managing exits:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>1. Recognizing Breakout Failures:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>80% Rule Application</b>: Since Brooks emphasizes that
     80% of breakouts fail, one of the primary exit strategies is to anticipate
     and act on these failures. If a trader has entered a position on what
     appears to be a breakout, they should be prepared to exit if the breakout
     does not sustain or if there are signs of reversal. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Failed Breakouts</b>: Specifically, if a breakout fails
     (like a bull breakout not following through or reversing), Brooks suggests
     exiting the position quickly. For example, if you're long on a breakout
     and the next few bars show a significant reversal or failure to push higher,
     it's time to sell.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>2. Using Reversal Bars for Exit:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reversals as Breakouts</b>: Brooks treats every
     reversal as a breakout in the opposite direction. If you're in a long
     position and you see a strong bear bar (or series of bars) that breaks
     below significant support (like the low of the breakout bar), this is a
     cue to exit your long position. Similarly, for short positions, a strong
     bull bar or sequence breaking above resistance might signal an exit.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>3. Stop Losses Based on Price Action:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategic Placement</b>: Brooks advocates for setting
     stop losses just beyond the key levels that were broken by the breakout
     (i.e., below the low of a bull breakout bar for long positions or above
     the high for short positions). This allows the trader to exit with a
     defined risk if the trade goes against them, based on the market's
     immediate reaction post-entry.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Protective Stops</b>: For example, if entering a long
     position on a breakout, placing a stop loss just below the low of the
     breakout bar or below a recent swing low can protect against significant
     losses if the breakout fails.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>4. Scalping and Small Profits:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Profit Taking</b>: Due to the high failure rate of
     breakouts, Brooks suggests that traders should aim for smaller, more
     frequent profits rather than holding out for large moves which are less
     likely. This means exiting positions once a modest profit target is
     achieved, especially in a trading range where breakouts are less likely to
     sustain.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>5. Market Inertia and Trading Range Dynamics:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exiting in Trading Ranges</b>: If the market is in a
     range and a trader has entered on what they believed was a breakout,
     Brooks recommends being quick to exit if the price action shows signs of
     returning to the range. This might involve selling near resistance for
     long positions or covering shorts near support.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>6. Reacting to Price Patterns:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Failed Patterns</b>: Patterns like failed double tops
     or bottoms, head and shoulders, or wedges where the breakout does not hold
     can be signals to exit. If the price action does not confirm the pattern's
     intent (e.g., not breaking out as expected), it's time to get out.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>7. Time Frame Considerations:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Intra-Bar Moves</b>: Brooks mentions intra-bar
     movements and tails, suggesting that if a bar opens strongly in one
     direction but closes opposite or with a significant tail, it might be wise
     to exit, as this indicates that the initial move might not continue.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks' exit strategy is highly dependent on reading price
action, understanding the probability of breakouts failing, and using this
knowledge to manage trades with a focus on minimizing risk while taking
advantage of the market's tendency to revert or remain in a range. His method
is about being proactive in exiting positions when the market's behavior
contradicts the initial trade thesis, using stop losses strategically, and not
holding onto trades hoping for a low-probability outcome.</p>

Executive Summary:</b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
In the first video of Al Brooks' eight-part series on breakouts, he introduces
key concepts central to his price action trading methodology. Brooks starts by
defining a breakout as either a single trend bar or a series of trend bars that
move beyond established support or resistance levels, which could include
highs, lows, trend lines, or moving averages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He then introduces his &quot;80% rule,&quot; which states
that 80% of breakouts fail, emphasizing the importance of this statistic for
traders. This rule suggests that markets have inertia; thus, whether in a trend
or a trading range, most breakout attempts will not succeed in changing the
market's current state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks further elaborates that every reversal can be
considered a breakout in the opposite direction. This perspective helps traders
see every market move as a potential trading opportunity, where even a reversal
is an opportunity for a breakout trade. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given the high failure rate of breakouts, especially within
trading ranges, Brooks advocates for strategies like buying low, selling high,
and scalping. He explains that in a trading range, where breakouts are likely
to fail, traders should aim for smaller, more frequent profits rather than
expecting large movements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The video also touches on the rarity of true breakout
follow-through, with only about 10% of bars on a chart showing significant
continuation after a breakout. Brooks uses various chart examples to illustrate
these points, discussing how traders might enter and exit positions based on
the strength or failure of breakouts and reversals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Overall, Brooks' teaching here is aimed at helping traders
understand the nuances of price action, particularly the probabilistic nature
of breakouts, encouraging a more disciplined approach to trading where one
expects and plans for breakout failures, using these insights to manage entries
and exits strategically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks
Speaks:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Look through the transcript at the references to the
specific examples Brooks makes, and talk about what he talks about, how it
relates to the context of the whole video, using specific quotations from
Brooks to make your points, both specific to his point or in a broader
context.&quot;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
Here's an analysis of some specific examples Al Brooks references in his video,
directly quoting him to illustrate how these examples relate to his broader
points about price action trading and breakouts:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Example 1: Breakout and Resistance Levels</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;A breakout always is a move beyond some
kind of support or resistance. If you have a full breakout like this, there are
several resistance levels that the market is breaking above. First of all, the
high of the prior bar is always resistance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Context</b>: Brooks uses this to establish the
     fundamental definition of a breakout. It's not just about moving past a
     single level but often involves multiple resistance points. This example
     underscores the complexity of breakouts, showing they're not just simple moves
     but involve interacting with various chart elements.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Example 2: The 80% Rule in Action</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;My 80 rule is that markets have inertia
and 80% of the time they resist change. So 80% of the time the market's in a
trend, reversal attempts will fail. And 80% of the time, if the market's in a
trading range, breakouts will fail.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Context</b>: This example is central to Brooks'
     philosophy. It explains why traders should be cautious about expecting
     breakouts to lead to sustained trends, emphasizing the need for strategies
     like scalping or quick profit-taking due to the high likelihood of failure.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Example 3: Double Bottom and Bear Breakout</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;Here we had a double bottom and a bear
breakout. Small head and shoulders top, left shoulder, head right shoulder. And
it failed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Specific Point</b>: This example shows how a pattern
     (double bottom) can lead to a breakout, which then fails, illustrating
     that not all pattern breakouts result in significant moves. It ties back
     to his point about most breakouts failing, urging traders to watch for
     these failures rather than assuming continuation.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Example 4: Bull Flag and Breakout Failures</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;And it's a bull flag, one bar pullback.
You can call it a two bar pullback. We started to pull back here, this bar
pulled back below that bar. So this is technically a pullback on this time
frame. And it's about a 50 pullback.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Relation to Context</b>: Here, Brooks discusses the
     setup and potential failure of a bull flag, which is a common pattern
     traders might trade on. He uses this to caution against over-optimism in
     trading setups, reinforcing the idea that even well-defined patterns like
     bull flags can lead to failed breakouts, aligning with his 80% rule.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Example 5: Market Inertia</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;Markets have inertia. That is my 80
rule. And by inertia, what I mean is the market tends to continue to do what it
has been doing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Broader Implication</b>: This example directly ties to
     the concept of market behavior where Brooks explains why traders should
     not expect sudden, sustained changes in market direction. It's a
     foundational piece of advice for understanding and anticipating market
     movements based on current trends or ranges.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Example 6: Tail Analysis</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;Every tail on every bar is a breakout.
This tail below. At one point this was a bear trend bar with a close down here.
But by the time the bar actually closed, it became bull.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Point Made</b>: Brooks here uses tails to illustrate
     how even within a bar's life, there are micro-breakouts and reversals.
     This example serves to teach traders to look for signs of potential
     reversals even within what might seem like a straightforward move,
     supporting his idea that every movement can be seen as a breakout.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Conclusion:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Through these examples, Brooks not only defines and dissects
the mechanics of breakouts but also instills a broader trading philosophy. He
teaches traders to anticipate failure, recognize patterns within patterns, and
understand the market's tendency towards inertia. Each example serves both as a
practical lesson in chart reading and a philosophical nod to his core trading
principles, particularly the pervasive influence of the 80% rule in trading
decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:107%'>Brooks
Speaks Specifically:</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Could you please identify and provide quotations from Al
Brooks that elucidate the trading calculations and behaviors of market
participants, particularly those that describe specific market conditions or
actions, akin to statements like &quot;when the market comes to the middle 1/3
of the channel, bulls buy again&quot;?</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
Here are specific quotations from Al Brooks that elucidate trading
calculations, behaviors of market participants, and describe specific market
conditions or actions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>On Market Behavior in Channels:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;In the case of a bull breakdown like
     here, at this point, it broke above the moving average and finally going
     to close above moving average. I always look at trend lines and there are
     different ways to draw them. I could use these two highs or I could use
     this high and that high. And clearly the market is breaking above the
     trend line as well.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quote discusses how bulls react when a market breaks
above significant indicators like moving averages or trend lines, suggesting a
buying opportunity or continuation of the uptrend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>On Trading Ranges and Breakout Failures:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;And 80% of the time, if the market's
     in a trading range, breakouts will fail. And that is the reality.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This indicates a behavioral expectation among traders where,
in a trading range, participants anticipate breakout failures, thus influencing
their trading decisions to either wait for confirmation or trade counter to the
breakout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>On Breakouts and Reversals:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;And the more resistance that the
     market breaks above, the more likely the breakout will have follow through
     and a second leg up or multiple legs up.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This statement explains the calculation traders might make
regarding the strength of a breakout, with the implication that if multiple
resistance levels are broken, there's a higher probability of a sustained move,
influencing buying behavior.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;Here we have a bear trend bar. So
     immediately think breakout. What did it break below? Well, it broke below
     this three bar full channel. It broke below this bar.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brooks here is teaching to recognize breakouts even in a
bear market context, where a significant down bar is seen as a breakout below
support, prompting selling or shorting behavior.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>On Specific Market Actions:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;So we broke below the range. Then we
     broke above the range.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This describes the action of market participants oscillating
between buying and selling as the market moves through its range, highlighting
the indecision and reversal tendencies within trading ranges.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;A lot of traders will sell on a stop
     below that bear bar betting that the bull breakout will fail and reverse
     down.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This quote gives insight into the tactical behavior of
traders, using stop orders to capitalize on potential failures of breakouts,
specifically betting against a bull breakout.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;If the bulls see this bar, their entry
     bar, they're going to be disappointed. They don't want to see a bear bar.
     They don't want to see a bar closing below its midpoint.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here, Brooks explains the sentiment shift and trading
behavior when a breakout signal doesn't hold, leading to disappointment among
bullish traders and potentially triggering sales or exits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>On Market Inertia and Trading Calculations:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;Markets have inertia. That is my 80
     rule. And by inertia, what I mean is the market tends to continue to do
     what it has been doing.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a calculation of market behavior where traders might
anticipate that current trends or range conditions will persist, affecting how
they enter or exit trades.</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;So a lot of traders will buy on a stop
     just about behind this bar, taking a chance that if the breakout is not
     successful. Maybe we'll pull back from the bar or two, hold above this low
     and then resume up with a high two or a high three.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This describes a specific strategy where traders calculate
stop entries based on potential pullbacks after a breakout, anticipating
another attempt at a breakout.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These quotes collectively illustrate Brooks' insights into
how traders calculate their moves based on observed market conditions, the
behavior of market participants in response to these conditions, and specific
actions taken in various market scenarios.</p>

(contrast, list, whatever) between tactics and strategy in regards to the
content of this video? Frame it in the format of the following but you are now
referring to the present video and not the content of the following example,
despite similarities.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
Here's a structured comparison between tactics and strategy as discussed by Al
Brooks in the context of the specific transcript provided, focusing on his
first video on breakouts:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Breakout Identification:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Recognizing breakouts by trend bars or
     series of trend bars moving beyond support or resistance.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;Breakout is simply a trend bar or a
     series of trend bars. So every trend bar that you see on the chart is the
     breakout.&quot; This tactic involves spotting the breakout for entry or
     exit points.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trading on Breakout Failures:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Selling strong bull closes or buying strong
     bear closes near the top or bottom of a trading range, expecting breakouts
     to fail.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Statement</b>: &quot;Smart bears, what they do is when
     they start to see strong bull bars, big bull trembles near the top of the
     range, they look to sell.&quot; This reflects a tactical move to trade
     against what appears to be a breakout.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Reversal as Breakout:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Treating every reversal as an opportunity
     for a breakout trade in the opposite direction.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight</b>: &quot;And every reversal is a breakout.
     And finally, since breakouts fail in our trading range, traders need to
     buy low, sell high and scalp.&quot; Here, the tactic is to look for
     reversals as new trading opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Stop Loss Placement:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Placing stops just beyond key breakout
     levels to manage risk.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;A lot of bulls will put their
     protective stop just below its low.&quot; This is a tactic for exiting
     trades when the trade thesis is invalidated.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Scalping Profits:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactic</b>: Taking smaller profits in anticipation of breakout
     failures, especially in trading ranges.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;And since they expect the trading
     range to continue, they scalp. They take big profits.&quot; This tactic
     focuses on quick, small gains.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>The 80% Rule Application:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Understanding that most breakouts fail,
     which informs overall trade management and patience.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Philosophy</b>: &quot;My 80% rule is that markets have
     inertia and 80% of the time they resist change.&quot; This strategy guides
     traders to expect and prepare for breakout failures.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Market Inertia and Range Trading:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Trading within the context of market
     inertia, where trends or ranges are likely to persist.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Insight</b>: &quot;So the market broke above this low,
     reversed up, broke above this high, reverse down, and it just repeatedly
     reversed breakout attempts.&quot; This strategy involves anticipating
     market behavior based on its tendency to remain in a state.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Trend Bar Interpretation:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Seeing every trend bar or series as a
     potential breakout, even if not immediately obvious.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quotation</b>: &quot;Every trend bar is a breakout.
     Every series of trend bars is a breakout.&quot; This strategy encourages a
     broader view of market movements.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Probability-Driven Decisions:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Making trading decisions based on the
     probabilities of market movements rather than certainties.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Brooks' Rule</b>: &quot;Only about 10% of the bars will
     be in a strong breakout that actually has follow through.&quot; This
     strategy promotes trading with an awareness of the low probability of
     significant follow-through.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Contextual Trading:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b>: Adjusting trading decisions based on the
     context of the market, whether in a trend or a range.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example</b>: &quot;And the more resistance that the
     market breaks above, the more likely the breakout will have follow
     through.&quot; This strategy involves reading the market's narrative to
     align trades with market conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Contrast:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Tactics</b> in this video revolve around immediate,
     actionable steps like spotting breakouts, managing entry/exit based on
     these breakouts, and leveraging the commonality of breakout failures for
     profit. They are the 'how to' of trading at the moment.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Strategy</b> involves the overarching approach to
     trading where Brooks emphasizes the understanding of market probabilities,
     the natural behaviors of markets (like inertia), and the broader context
     of price action. It's about 'why' these tactics are chosen, ensuring they
     fit within the larger framework of market dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, while tactics are about the operational aspects
of trading, Brooks' strategy in this video is about understanding and
leveraging market behavior over time, focusing on why certain tactics should be
employed based on the overarching market conditions.</p>

fail. Following this, Brooks delves into the analysis of different types of
breakouts and reversals, teaching participants how to interpret bar patterns,
identify potential failed breakouts, and make informed trading decisions. The
webinar also covers essential trading strategies, examining market behavior and
the influence of inertia on trading choices, alongside a discussion on trading

  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;Breakout is simply a trend bar or a
      series of trend bars.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The 80% Rule</b>: Both emphasize Brooks' 80% rule about
     the failure rate of breakouts, highlighting its significance in trading
     strategy.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;My 80 rule is that markets have
      inertia and 80% of the time they resist change. So 80% of the time the
      market's in a trend, reversal attempts will fail.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reversals as Breakouts</b>: The concept that every
     reversal can be seen as a breakout is noted in both summaries.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;And every reversal is a
      breakout.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Inertia</b>: Both summaries touch on Brooks'
     point about market inertia, explaining why most breakouts fail.</li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;Markets have inertia. That is my 80
      rule. And by inertia, what I mean is the market tends to continue to do
      what it has been doing.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Differences:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Specificity in Examples</b>: My summary includes more
     detailed examples from the transcript where Brooks discusses specific
     chart patterns, like double bottoms or head and shoulders, and how these
     relate to breakout failures or successes. Fireflies.ai provides a broader
     overview of types without delving into these specifics.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Example from My Summary</b>: &quot;Here we had a
      double bottom and a bear breakout. Small head and shoulders top, left
      shoulder, head right shoulder. And it failed.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Focus on Trading Tactics vs. Strategy</b>: My summary
     distinguishes between the tactical (immediate actions like spotting and
     trading on breakouts) and strategic (understanding market behavior,
     probability, and the 80% rule) aspects of Brooks' teaching. Fireflies.ai
     has a more generalized approach to trading strategies without this
     contrast.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Depth of Market Behavior Analysis</b>: I delve deeper
     into how traders should react to different market conditions based on
     Brooks' teachings, like trading within ranges or anticipating breakout
     failures. Fireflies.ai, while mentioning market behavior, doesn't go into
     these tactical nuances.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote from My Summary</b>: &quot;Smart bears, what
      they do is when they start to see strong bull bars, big bull trembles
      near the top of the range, they look to sell.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Emphasis on Educational Value</b>: Fireflies.ai's
     summary frames the webinar as educational, providing an outline of topics
     covered. My summary, while educational, focuses more on actionable
     insights from Brooks' specific statements.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>What's Salient in the Video:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Understanding Breakouts</b>: The core of the video is
     understanding what constitutes a breakout, emphasizing its visual
     representation on charts.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The 80% Rule</b>: This is arguably the most critical
     takeaway, as it shapes the trader's expectation and strategy. </li>
 <ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=circle>
  <li class=MsoNormal><b>Quote</b>: &quot;And 80% of the time, if the market's
      in a trading range, breakouts will fail.&quot;</li>
 </ul>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Market Inertia</b>: Brooks' concept of market inertia
     is vital for traders to grasp why breakouts often fail and how to use this
     knowledge in trading.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Reversals</b>: Viewing every reversal as a breakout
     changes how one might interpret market moves, offering more trading
     opportunities.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Practical Application</b>: The practical advice on
     trading based on these principles, like selling strong bull closes or
     buying bear closes, gives traders actionable steps.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In conclusion, while both summaries cover the foundational
elements of Brooks' discussion on breakouts, mine focuses on the practical
application and nuanced understanding of these concepts through Brooks'
specific examples and teachings, whereas Fireflies.ai provides a structured
overview of the session's content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<b><br>
Chosen Indicator</b>: Moving Average</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Important/Featured Topic</b>: Breakouts and the 80% Rule</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>How the Moving Average Works:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Moving Average (MA) is a technical indicator that
smooths out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. There
are primarily two types used in trading:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Simple Moving Average (SMA)</b>: This calculates the
     average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, over a
     specific number of periods. For example, a 20-period SMA would sum up the
     last 20 closing prices and divide by 20.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</b>: This gives more
     weight to recent prices, making it more responsive to new information.
     It's calculated using a formula that applies a higher weight to the most
     recent price.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the context of the video:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Breakouts</b>: A breakout is identified when the price
     moves significantly above or below a moving average, which often acts as a
     dynamic support or resistance level. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>The 80% Rule</b>: Al Brooks emphasizes that 80% of
     breakouts fail, suggesting that moving averages can be used not just to
     identify potential breakouts but also to anticipate their failure.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Interpretation of Use in Day Trading:</b></p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Entry Signals</b>: When price breaks above an MA
     (especially EMA due to its responsiveness) in an uptrend or below in a
     downtrend, it could signal a breakout. Traders might consider this a buy
     (bullish breakout) or sell (bearish breakout) signal.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Confirmation</b>: The moving average can help confirm
     the strength of a trend. If a breakout is accompanied by the price closing
     above the MA in a bull market, it might indicate a stronger move.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Support and Resistance</b>: MAs can act as support in
     uptrends and resistance in downtrends. If price repeatedly bounces off an
     MA, it validates the MA as a significant level for trading decisions.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>Exit Strategy</b>: Given the 80% rule, traders using
     MAs might set stop losses just below the MA after a bullish breakout or
     above after a bearish one, anticipating potential failure.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Speculation on Al Brooks' Commentary:</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Al Brooks might comment on the moving average in the
following ways, based on his style and points from the video:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><br>
<br>
</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;The moving average is just another form of
     resistance or support; it's not magical.&quot;</b> - Brooks would likely
     caution against over-reliance on MAs alone, emphasizing that price action
     itself is the primary indicator. He might view MAs as useful for
     identifying where the market might have difficulty moving through.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;When you see a breakout above the moving average,
     remember, 80% of those breakouts are going to fail. Don't be quick to jump
     in; wait for follow-through or at least a retest.&quot;</b> - Here, Brooks
     would align the use of MAs with his 80% rule, advising traders to look for
     additional signals or market context before committing to a trade based
     solely on a MA crossover.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Look for how the price interacts with the moving
     average. If it's a strong trend, the price should respect the MA, even if
     it's just to pull back to it before continuing.&quot;</b> - He'd likely
     use the MA to explain market behavior, such as in small pullback trends or
     when discussing how to scalp profits in a range-bound market.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Don't get too caught up with the exact placement
     of your moving average. It's the trend and the price action around it that
     matters, not the line itself.&quot;</b> - Brooks would stress the
     importance of understanding market inertia and the natural flow of price
     action over precise indicator readings.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><b>&quot;Every time you see a price close above the moving
     average, think about the bears who got trapped. They'll be looking to sell
     if the price comes back down, which is why many breakouts fail.&quot;</b>
     - He might relate the MA to market psychology, explaining why breakouts
     often reverse, tying back to his teaching on trading within ranges and the
     failure of breakouts.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In summary, while Brooks wouldn't dismiss the moving
average, he'd likely use it as a tool within the broader context of price
action, emphasizing its limitations and the importance of recognizing when
breakouts fail, in line with his 80% rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:20.0pt;line-height:107%'>Transcript
for Video</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm Al Brooks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thank you for watching the Brooks training course.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the first of eight videos on breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm going to begin by talking about exactly what I mean,
what I break out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'll then talk about my 80% rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that is in part that 80% of breakouts fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, I want to make a point about every reversal being a
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And finally, since breakouts fail in our trading range,
traders need to buy low, sell high and scalp.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Breakout is simply a trend bar or a series of trend
bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So every trend bar that you see on the chart is the
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And sometimes you get a series of trend bars and they form a
breakout beer breakout there will break out here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>01:10</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It can be one bar and it can grow into several bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A breakout always is a move beyond some kind of support or
resistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have a full breakout like this, there are several
resistance levels that the market is breaking above.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First of all, the high of the prior bar is always
resistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next you have a lower high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next you have a trend line.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next you have the moving average.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we had a double bottom and a bear breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Small head and shoulders top, left shoulder, head right
shoulder.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it failed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the bulls were able to get a micro level bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the bears tried to sell off in the bulls bought, the
bears tried to sell off again and the bull spot even more aggressively,
creating a good buy signal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>02:05</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Water in this particular case, market broke below a double
bottom and then it broke back above.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So that is a breakout, the breakout back above the double
bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As breakouts grow, they tend to go above higher and higher
resistance levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the case of a bull breakdown like here, at this point, it
broke above the moving average and finally going to close above moving
average.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I always look at trend lines and there are different ways to
draw them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could use these two highs or I could use this high and
that high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And clearly the market is breaking above the trend line as
well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the market's breaking above a bare trend line.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I said that it broke above the high of this bear bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But I also look at prior lower highs, a bear trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>03:07</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the more resistance that the market breaks above, the
more likely the breakout will have follow through and a second leg up or
multiple legs up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're breaking above prior lower high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then we broke above another lower high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this point, you can call this a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every head and shoulders top, left shoulder, head right
shoulder is a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe the Trading range began here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We went down, went up, move down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We went up, down and up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a lower high, but it's also a trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we broke below the range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we broke above the range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My 80 rule is that markets have inertia and 80% of the time
they resist change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So 80% of the time the market's in a trend, reversal
attempts will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>04:06</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And 80% of the time, if the market's in a trading range,
breakouts will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that is the reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the market broke above this low, reversed up, broke above
this high, reverse down, and it just repeatedly reversed breakout
attempts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>New high failed, new low failed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We tried to reverse up, fail, broke to a new low, failed,
broke above this high, fail above this side, pulled back this time we pulled
back, trying to reverse down, tried to fail here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We tried to reverse down, and we succeeded.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We broke below the bottom of this strong rally, but the
breakout failed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, a really important point about breakouts is that on
any chart, any time frame, only about 10% of the bars will be in a strong
breakout that actually has follow through.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you can look at this chart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>05:06</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe it has 100 bars on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we have a few bars down here, a few bars up here, a few
bars down here, and a few more bars down there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But only 10% of the bars actually follow through.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this sell off had a little bit of follow through.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This buying had a little bit of follow through, this sell
off, and a little bit of follow through.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of the bars, 90 of the bars on the chart are either in
channels or in trading ranges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if the bars are pretty big trend bars, when the
market's in a channel or a trading range, 80% of the breakouts will fail to get
very far foreign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a pair of pretty good bull bars, especially this
bar, followed by a bear bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then we have a bull flag, one bar pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>05:57</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can call it a two bar pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We started to pull back here, this bar pulled back below
that bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this is technically a pullback on this time frame.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's about a 50 pullback.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's a bull bar tail on top following a big bear
reversal bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not a high probability buy, but the market's still always in
long at that point.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it is a high one bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it is a buy setup.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But bull flags like this very commonly have breakouts that
fail and reverse down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So a lot of traders will buy on a stop just about behind
this bar, taking a chance that if the breakout is not successful.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe we'll pull back from the bar or two, hold above this
low and then resume up with a high two or a high three.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>06:49</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I said, this is a high one bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But a pretty prominent tail above and a prominent tail
below.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The body is less than half the height of the bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I would call that a doji bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if the bulls see this bar, their entry bar, they're
going to be disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They don't want to see a bear bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They don't want to see a bar closing below its
midpoint.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That tells us that in this particular case, there probably
were more sellers above the high of this bull flag than buyers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bears will see that, and instead of buying this breakout,
they'll sell it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bears are betting that most breakout attempts will fail
and that this is a fairly decent reversal after a small two bar breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it's a bad looking buy signal bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>07:42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At a minimum, it's possibly a reasonable scalp hitting the
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first reversal up from the pullback will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have a full breakout and an attempt to make the
breakout fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And by this bar going below the low of that bar, it triggers
a failed full breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of traders will sell on a stop below that beer bar
betting that the bull breakout will fail and reverse them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of traders will sell that betting that the bull
breakout will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And remember, every reversal is a breakout of
something.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we have a Bear bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You should think of it as a breakout as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I were to draw a trend line up from below this bar to the
high of this bar, it would be vertical.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>08:42</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or we could draw a trend line from the low of this bar to
the high of that bar and it would be a trend on a smaller tankering chart in
this beer bar is a reversal down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My point is that whenever I see a reversal down after a bull
breakout, I think the reversal down is a bear breakup.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think of it that way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think of it as if there was an obvious breakout
here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clearly there's not an obvious breakout here, but it's a
reversal attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I think of every reversal attempt as a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, which breakout is stronger, the bull Breakout or the
Bear Breakout?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Clearly the bull breakout is stronger and therefore it's not
particularly high probability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sell below that low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>09:28</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pairs will take the cell taking a chance that will just keep
going down, knowing that the probability is low, but the risk is low as
well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They're putting a stop above the high of the bar or
both.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The height of the bull breakout and taking a chance that
It's a start of a big bear trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Low probability, great risk reward.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This bear bar might not be strong enough to reverse
that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there might be more buyers than sellers this far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And clearly, if you're a bear and you shorted, you do not
like the bull close.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You do not like your entry bar failing to become a big bear
bar closing on this level.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So a lot of beers are disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bear trend tried to resume down again here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10:13</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And they have a bear bar but a much weaker bear bar, big
tail on the bottom of the bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we had a bear bar here, tried to get a bear breakout, got
a bull bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We had another attempt at a bear breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Could not close below the prior bar, just like this, could
not close below that bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here we have a closed at or above the midpoint of the
bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this is not a very good looking breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's telling us that there might be more traders believing
the opposite of the beers sold, betting that the bull breakout will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But it looks like there probably were more bulls buying at
the low of this bar betting that the bear reversal would fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Which is logical because most reversals fail almost
reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11:05</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, if a trader thinks that buyers will win above or below
bar, he should buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Look at this rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have three bull bars, not great big tails, but two of
them closed well above the midpoint.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This one has a pretty good sized body and a close above the
high of the prior bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So there's a gap there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is this going to be a fail full breakout?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a low probability short.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There probably are more buyers at the low of this bar than
there are sellers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So some bears will sell looking for a move below here and
down, but probably three consecutive bulldars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably more buyers than sellers, probably more traders
than.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, because of the absence of big bull trend bars
closing on their highs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have prominent tails, couple small bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11:59</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls know that there might be a deep pullback and a
trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it's okay to buy if you use the correct stock here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this point we have a pair of bull bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This one closing on its high and it's a higher low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a higher probability buy than there, but both are
appropriate buys.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So here bulls thought pretty strong rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably buyers below at this point, they see a higher low
with two bull bars and they're thinking that, well, there probably have buyers
above this bar as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So buyers below that bar and buyers above this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A seller the exact opposite.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If he thinks that the sellers will win, you should
sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So for example he might say not a very good rally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Buy Signal bar has a pretty prominent tail on top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12:54</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a micro double top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Up and down, up and down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe we'll enter a tight trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe I'll sell above the high of this bull bar as a fairly
prominent sale.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I'll sell there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And maybe I'll sell below this bear bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have another version of a micro double top and triple
top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Up, down, up, down, up and going down again for the Bear
bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Closing in the slow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a second entry sell for the failed bull Breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Full breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First entry, cell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then went up again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have a better looking cell sign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is a higher probability short than selling below that
bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So you have beer selling above this bar and selling below
that bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of the time, if not most of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders are fairly uncertain what to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>13:50</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's the nature of markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>See, they strive for confusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if at any time you're not sure, then just wait.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should you buy above this bar?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should you sell above this bar?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should you buy above this bar?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sell above this bar?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should you buy or sell below that bar?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you're not sure, best choice is this weight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I mentioned examples of support and resistance that can lead
to breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does it matter what type of breakout it is?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Break above, prior higher or low trend line moving, average
doesn't matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All that matters is that there's a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of times if you're a beginner, you don't even see
what's being broken out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But again, it doesn't matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The breakout is strong enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But you don't need to see or understand what's being
broken.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember, every trend bar is a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>14:47</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every series of trend bars is a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the bigger the bars, the more they close on their
high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We're talking about a bull breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The stronger the breakout and the more likely there'll be at
least a two legged move here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three persons up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we have a Bear bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it's a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every reversal is a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then this is clearly a breakout or a breakout of what
many things.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a wedge top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it's a break below the bottom of the wedge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a break below the trend line.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have a very big bull bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of bulls will put their protective stop just below its
low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it's a breakout below the bottom of a very big bull
bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A biclimax bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>15:39</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have a rally not nearly as strong as the sell off
and that follow through, we keep getting pullbacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have here a little triangle, a little breakout of the
triangle, reversing them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So this is basically a bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we have a small early bear trend and we test it back
up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders will view it as a bear flag and they'll look to sell
or break out below the bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They'll also look to sell to break out below this low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Below that low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Look at the trend line at the bottom of the trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can see we're failing at the 60 minute moving
average.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a five minute chart of the euro versus the
dollar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we're failing to break above the 60 minute moving
average.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still we get above it here, here and then here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>16:27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we're starting to reverse down again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bear breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tried to reverse up to a small bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is a breakout below the bear flag, another small
bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then at the bottom here we have a spike and channel
bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Their breakout spike.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three pushes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One, two, three.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So a small wedge bottom after a beer breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we're trying to reverse up again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every bull bar is a trend bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a breakout, it's a climax.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is a little bull breakout above the top of the
wedge bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Channel is tight like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably even a strong reversal up like this is going to be
minor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A whole leg in that trading range rather than the chargeable
trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That means that the rally probably has to test down here we
got a higher low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bulls are hoping for a trend reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>17:27</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not likely when the channel down is this type.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can see here, we broke below that low, but then we broke
above this high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is this the major lower high and the start of a bull trend
up here?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No, it's not a major low high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It did not result in a strong reversal down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It did not result in a new launch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So it's a minor lower high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A breakout above it probably will not get very far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it did not.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It reversed down on the next bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another leg down, another two legged rally low, one low,
two.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So another bear flag break below the bear flag double bottom
attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We've got a bear breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So that's a wedge three pushes down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every double bottom is one push, two pushes down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the market breaks below it, that's a third push
down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>18:17</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So even though it does not look like a wedge, it's a
wedge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's a nested wedge because it's within a larger
wedge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have a bull trend bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we're Getting a reversal up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trying to break out above a wedge to be a channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trying to form a micro double bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That would be a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then we have another attempt at a bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You broke below it, but immediately reversed up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this point, pretty strong bull breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well above the moving average.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are gap bars here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gaps between the lows of the bars and the moving average.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And therefore the sell off that tests the lower the bear
trend probably will be the final leg down before we get an attempt at a major
trend removal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And here we got a higher low, major trend reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>19:07</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the second line up, we got a bull breakout and a pullback
around 50.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The seller is weaker than the rally and we have a wedge
bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So probably two legs up, one pulled back two.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And this is also a higher low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Major trend reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So bears channel bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You got a bull breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We got breakouts above minor, lower highs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A double top attempt by the bears, double top neckline beer
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>No, we have a double top and instead we got a full
breakup.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then we got a breakout above this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wedge rally free versus up 1, 2, 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other ways to count it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In any case, it's a bull channel and this is a break
below.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bull channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Did not get very far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have a bear channel, a bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20:05</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a breakout above it, not particularly strong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Got another bull channel and we broke below it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have an attempt at a higher low and broke.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm telling you that every trend bar or series of trend bars
is a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And a lot of times you look at the chart and say, why
not?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There's something being broken out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This chart is an example of a lot of little things that are
being broken out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'm just trying to explain what a lot of the computers are
seeing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Computers are looking for breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And these are the kinds of things that different computers
look for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of them are minor and most of the breakout attempts
fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It can be a single trend bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many terms of the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>20:59</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can call this a strong trend bar, strong series of trend
bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A breakout, a spike, a climax, a gap, a reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This could be a reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It could have gone down here and then up here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's all the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Those are all synonyms for trend bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a bullshit bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, which term I use depends on what took place over here
to the left.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the market was selling off.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And reverse up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would call this reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's still a buy climax.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's still a bull breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's still a spike.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably has some kind of a gap between this close and
something the high maybe of the prior bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But all that really is important is it's a bull trend
bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so it's a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>21:52</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if you don't know what's being broken out, you see a
bull trend bar, It's a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consecutive bull trend bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a stronger breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because not only do we have higher price, but we have more
time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The market has been breaking out for a longer period of
time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three consecutive bull trend bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have three consecutive bull trend bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even a stronger breakout, the reversal down, probably
minor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's big enough down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So we have a big up, big down reversal product to go
sideways for a few bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this chart is still always in long.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every breakout, no matter how strong, eventually tries to
reverse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But most reversal attempts fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've said a couple times today that every reversal is a
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A lot of times it doesn't look like a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It just looks like a reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>22:54</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it doesn't matter if you call it a reversal or a
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a breakout there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have a beer trend bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So immediately think breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What did it break below?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, it broke below this three bar full channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It broke below this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Does not matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anytime I see a big trend bar, a bear trend bar, I think
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Again, the choice of the term depends on what took
place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To the left here were rallying.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have a big bear trend bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I would refer to that as a reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But it's still a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a bull breakout and this represents a failed bull
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whether that will lead to a trend or trading range or a
pause in the trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And a bull flag and trend exemption up, too early to
tell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>23:48</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But it's a bear reversal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It's a fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bull breakout, foreign this point, many times throughout the
course, the breakouts are common.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every trend bar, every series of trend bars is a
breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lots of bull breakdowns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a big bull breakout made up of many smaller bull
breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bear breakout, other beta breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some have two bars, some of more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here's three bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Do I count that as part of the breakout?&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I typically do not mean that's a poise bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And then we accelerated down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I would call that markets have inertia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That is my 80 rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And by inertia, what I mean is the market tends to continue
to do what it has been doing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So anytime I see a breakout like this, I look to the left
trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chances are the breakout will fail eventually fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>24:49</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If I'm looking at a reasonably strong rally, I see a
breakout here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chances are we're going to get some follow through climb
because bars to the left.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We've had seven bars up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Seven bull bars.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now every tail on every bar is a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This tail below.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At one point this was a bear trend bar with a close down
here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But by the time the bar actually closed, it became
bulma.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The market traded below this level.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a bear trend small rally bear flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And it was a break below the bear flag and it failed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now we have a low two bear flag and these bars all have
tails below.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That means they all represent failed breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tails at the tops of bars build bull breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have a bull flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We tried to break out and try to break out fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>25:47</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So every tail is a failed breakout attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Trading range breakouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like I said, the markets have inertia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if the market has been going sideways, chances are it'll
continue to go sideways.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And 80% of attempts to have it break out into a Trend will
fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5 Minute Chart Euro versus the end up and down
repeatedly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have a decent bear bar and good follow through at
the bottom of the range at a prior low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here we have a full breakout to a new high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Strong bull bars trap traders in the buying high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both are hopeful.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like you see a bottle like this, you say oh wow, this is
clearly going to be into the trading range from the start of the
bullfront.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, it's not.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most trading range breakouts fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even very strong ones like this or like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>26:49</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beginners, they tend to buy these full closes betting on a
successful breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Forgetting my 80 rule, smart bears, what they do is when
they start to see strong bull bars, big bull trembles near the top of the
range, they look to sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They can either sell the stops on a reversal down like below
that bar below this bar or a lot of them will look at strong bull closes and
sell the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So as soon as that bar closes, they hit sell the market and
they get filled on the open of the next bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every breakout is a climax that's at the top and the cell
climax at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And 80% of those breakouts will lead to reversals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And a reversal is simply a trend bar in the opposite
direction, which is a breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>27:43</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I said bears will sell strong bull closes near the
top.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They'll also sell reversals down which is slightly higher
probability than selling.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both loses a pair of very strong bear bottoms at the
bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Terrible follow through Another bear breakout attempt
another one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And they're all failing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Very strong bear bar closing far below this bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But still within the trading range.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bars like that trap traders into selling low.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Traders are naturally hopeful and then thinking, wow, that's
so strong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This has got to be the start of the air trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And look at this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have an extremely strong bull bar and now we're breaking
below the low level.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So certainly this one up as a measuring gap and lead to a
big move down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>28:35</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, it did not break over below the trading range and the
next bar as a bull, Chances are the spirit breakout will not get very
far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And the bulls know that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So every time they see a big bear bar closing near the
bottoms, well, they're going to be buying those bear closes, betting that the
80 rule will apply.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That beer breakouts will fail every big bear bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It looks like a strong breakout and the start of a spare
trend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They bet 80% of the time those breakouts will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other bulls prefer to buy reversals up, so they'll buy after
the breakout reverses up above gold levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here, here, and here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I began talking about what exactly I mean by a breakout, and
then moved on to my 80% rule that 80% of breakout attempts will fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>S</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Stephen Crane</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>29:41</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, I made a point that every reversal is a breakout in
the opposite direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I may not call it a reversal, and I may not call it an
opposite breakout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I typically call it the reversal, but it is a breakout, even
though it may not be obvious on the time frame in front of you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And finally, because of the 80 rule, if the market's in a
trading range, it does not matter how strong the bull bars are at the top or
how strong the bear bars are at the bottom, the breakouts are probably going to
fail.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So traders buy low, they sell high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And since they expect the trading range to continue, they
scout.&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They take big profits.&nbsp;</p>
